# Lab Task #6

- Entrant → Customer
- Each event is assigned to a Waitingroom
- Scheduler → Organizer
    - Can block / “put to sleep” a thread (Readylist → Waitingroom)
    - and “wake it up” again (Waitingroom → Readylist)
- Events in OOStuBS

## Synchronization Object Semaphore

- p() : wait, block, consumer
    - If == 0: Wait for v() (wait)
    - Else: decrease by 1
- v() signal, PRODUCER
    - If a thread is waiting: Signal the event (signal)
        - Wake up waiting thread
        - What happens if multiple threads are waiting?
    - Else: increase by 1
    

## Synchronization Object Keyboard

- Goal: Use the CPU for other purposes while waiting for I/O
- Thread reads from the keyboard
    - Keyboard driver’s getkey() returns Keys
    - as long as there are some in the (software) keyboard buffer
    - When keyboard buffer is empty:
        - Thread blocks
        - Waits for event “Keyboard buffer filled again” (wait)
    - Signaling of this event (signal)
        - Keyboard interrupt
        - Epilogue, due to access from thread level
        - why in epilogue we cannot block(why V() is in the epilogue level)
            - if we block within an epilogue level, the epilogue level stays locked and we will nevel be able to enter this level →so the producing side will never done
- Implementation
    - Semaphore that counts keys in the keyboard buffer
    

## Synchronization Object Buzzer

- Buzzer: an alarm clock
    - With sleep() threads can block and wait until this alarm clock rings
    - After a period of time specified in set()
    - the ring() method wakes up waiting threads
- derived from Bell
    - Has a counter
    - that is counted down with tick()
    - and calls ring() when run down (run_down() == true)
- Bellringer : triggered by timer intr
    - manages Bell objects
    - every timer tick checks whether they have run down and rings them in this case
- Implementation:
    - without Semaphore
        - directly with Waitingroom and Organizer (why?)
        - semantically different

## Synchronization Objects in OOStuBS

- … are part of the kernel state
    - Keyboard and Buzzer signal events in the epilogue
        - Can we also wait for events in the epilogue? → why in epilogue we cannot block(why V() is in the epilogue level)
            - if we block within an epilogue level, the epilogue level stays locked and we will nevel be able to enter this level →so the producing side will never done
- … and therefore must reside on the epilogue level
    - Guarded_Semaphore
    - Guarded_Buzzer
    - Guarded_Keyboard

# Idle-Loop, considered harmful

## Idling

## What should we do when last thread also blocks?

- in normal case all threads are waiting for an event, but the last thread also blocks.there is no more threads in readylist, What now?
    - simple loop: wait until readylist in not empty anymore
    
    ```cpp
    While(!(next = readylist.dequeue())) ;
    ```
    
    - busy waitting, waste energy
        - what does idle do: hlt until intr comes in
            
            ```nasm
            cpu_idle:
             sti
             hlt
             ret
            ```
            
        
        ```cpp
        While(!(next = readylist.dequeue())) 
        	->
        			cpu.idle();
        ```
        
    - What if we have intr here
        - The thread will never actually run cuz we run cpu.idle() after the thread.
    - Scheduler::schedule()
        
        ```cpp
        cli;    
        While(!(next = readylist.dequeue())) {
        		cpu.idle(); // include sti so we still need to cli
        		cli;
        }
        ```
        
        - The code above is part of block function and called in the epilogue level , epilogue is locked
            - situation1  : timer epilog triggers bellringer and signal one buzzer and sets all threads  ready to wait for the buzzer
            - situation 2 : keyboard epilog delivers a key to software keyboard buffer which is synchronized by the semaphor (semaphor v() →waking up a thread that was blocking on the keyboard buffer)
        - both happens in epilogue, epilogue are suquentialized, will not excuted right away when the epilogue is locked (INTR is handled), so if you stay on this implementation epilogue will not been excuted and we will never leave this loop.
        - what can we do about this?
            - we might have to leave level 1/2, make sure epilogue can be excuted in order to have threads been set ready.
                - modified code
                    
                    ```cpp
                    guard.leave();  //make sure epi can be excuted
                    cli;    
                    While(!(next = readylist.dequeue())) {
                    		cpu.idle(); // include sti so we still need to cli
                    		cli;
                    }
                    sti;
                    guard.enter();
                    dispatch(next);
                    ```
                    
                - now epilogue can be excuted
                - Problem: Watch epilogue does only resume() in task5, in task6 it will also notify the bellringer that one more time tick happended(bellringer.check())
        - 以上细节不会在考试里考
        - idle thread: add a thread that we define will never been block, make sure readylist will never be empty
        
        ```cpp
        while(1) ;
        ```
        
        - busy waitting..
        - so the simple Solution is : once the ready_list is empty resume to idle thread.
        
        ```cpp
        while(1){
        	cpu.idle();
        }
        ```
        

# Non-Blocking Thread Synchronization

## Thread Synchronization: Assumptions

- Threads can be preempted unpredictably
    - at any time (also by external events)
        - interrupts
    - by any other thread
        - of higher, same or lower priority (progress guarantee!)
- Typical assumptions for desktop computers
    - probabilistic, interactive, preemptive, online CPU scheduling
    - We do not consider other scheduling variants here.
- Assume we don’t need “progress guarantee”
- Several application levels
    - Instead of threads: one control flow per level
- Do we still need coroutines?
    - What can’t we do without them?
    - without coroutine we cannot wait passivly for coroutine
    

# example

## OSEK-OS: Resource Management (1)

- Synchronization when accessing shared resources, e.g. global
variables, I/O devices, …
- Avoids known issues of semaphores:
    - Priority Inversion
