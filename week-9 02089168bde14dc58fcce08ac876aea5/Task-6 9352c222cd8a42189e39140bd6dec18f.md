# Task-6

# Idling

## What should we do when last thread also blocks?

- simple loop
    
    ```cpp
    While(!(next = readylist.dequeue())) ;
    ```
    
    - busy waitting, waste energy
- 
    
    ```cpp
    While(!(next = readylist.dequeue())) 
    	->	cpu.idle();
    ```
    
    - continues execution after the hlt.
    - hlt : enables intr before instead of disabling it
- What if we have intr here
    - The thread will never actually run cuz we run cpu.idle() after the thread.
    - Scheduler::schedule()
    
    ```cpp
    cli;    
    While(!(next = readylist.dequeue())) {
    		cpu.idle(); // include sti so we still need to cli
    		cli;
    }
    ```
    
- The code above is part of block function and called in the epilogue level , epilogue is locked
    - timer epilog triggers bellringer and signal one buzzer and sets all threads  ready to wait for the buzzer
    - keyboard epilog delivers a key to software keyboard buffer which is synchronized by the semaphor (semaphor v() →waking up a thread that was blocking on the keyboard buffer)
    - both happens in epilogue, epilogue are suquentialized, will not excuted right away when the epilogue is locked (INTR is handled), so if you stay on this implementation epilogue will not been excuted and we will never leave this loop.
    - what can we do about this?
        - we might have to leave level 1/2, make sure epilogue can be excuted in order to have threads been set ready.
        - modified code
        
        ```cpp
        guard.leave();  //make sure epi can be excuted
        cli;    
        While(!(next = readylist.dequeue())) {
        		cpu.idle(); // include sti so we still need to cli
        		cli;
        }
        sti;
        guard.enter();
        dispatch(next);
        ```
        
        - Problem: Watch epilogue does only resume() in task5, in task6 it will also notify the bellringer that one more time tick happended(bellringer.check())
        - idle thread: add a thread that we define will never been block, make sure readylist will never be empty
        
        ```cpp
        while(1) ;
        ```
        
        - busy waitting..
        - so the simple Solution is :
        
        ```cpp
        while(1){
        	cpu.idle();
        }
        ```
        
        # semaphor
        
        - prolaag(), P(), wait(), down(), acquire(), pend()
            - if counter > 0, decrease counter
            - if counter ≤ 0, wait until counter > 0 and retry
        - verhoog(), V(), signal(), up(), release(), post()
            - increase counter
            - if counter = 1, wake up possibly waiting thread
