# PC Bus Systems (and how to program them)

# PCI(**Peripheral Component Interconnect**) Bus

- Typical architecture of the first PCI systems:

- The North Bridge decouples host bus and PCI bus. Thus, PCI units and CPU can work in parallel.
- The PCI connection between North and South Bridge was later replaced by something faster.
- Bridges help integrating ISA and PCI transparently in one system.

## PCI – Basic Data

- Specification version 1.0 by Intel (1991)
    - since 1993, the PCI-SIG issues specifications
- CPU-type independent
    - PCI also exists in SPARC, Alpha, Arm and PowerPC systems
- 32/64 bit, multiplexed address/data bus
    - adr and data over the same bus
- in burst mode max. 132 MB/s respectively 264 MB/s
- 4 interrupt lines (INTA-D)
    - problem: old ISA bus has more, 4 intr line for all devices, cannot have all devices use their own intr number→using intr sharing, intr driver now need to decide  which device calls intr
- Scalable due to bridges and multi-function units
- Multi-Master capabilities (better than classic DMA)
    - there is no 1 master to control all transparent of bus, each participant on the bus can actually take over the roll of the bus master which leads to the more efficient  data transfers.
- Mechanism to detect and auto-configure devices(resource allocation)
    - e.g. sound card game usually have configration tool, run the setup tool, and setup will ask u which sound card do u have, so u have to manuelly tell the system  u have a sound master or sth and manuelly tell the game the configuration tool and bty it uses intr 6, and I/O port listen that.
    

## Interacting with PCI Devices

- device driver still use mem areas, some device registers are mapped into mem, it would also contact devices via the I/O adr space.
- in order these device to actually can use this I/O adr space, first there is PCI Initialization, the **PCI BIOS** contact all PCI devices though **Configuration address space.**before the congiguration issues been placed, this devices don’t map anything into the mem and  I/O adr space
- firstly been configured then it can been used

## The PCI Configuration Space

- On the PC, the configuration space is accessed indirectly via I/O ports:
- 2 I/O Ports : one for data, one for adr, 32bit wide
- which internel register in the PCI configuration space do i want to access →  access through this key hole? (2. register)
- BUS Unit and Fct : defines which device do i want to access
    - devices are connected to buses, and buses are numbered starting with bus nr 0
    - within the bus we can adress a unit(32 unit)
    - within the unitwe can adress a Fct(8 Fct)
        - fuction is part og the device, e. g. u could have 1 chip that connected to the PCI bus that contains 4 USB ctrllers, this would be usually be implemented as a fct within that unit
- Register: define which register within that device configuration space do i want to access
    - 256 bytes configuration space each devices
    - register id : 6 bit < 256 byte
    - last 2 zero are also the part of configration space

![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%202.png)

- this 32 bit is aligned to the configuration space.

### 64-byte header format:

- **Vendor** and **Device ID** uniquely identify a device. **Revision ID** and Class Code provide additional information.
    - Vendor ID 0xffff means ‘non-existent’.
    - Vendor ID is also used to actually search for devices.
        - 256 buses up to 32 devices per bus up to 8 functions per device. u can simply scan through all devices, brute force try all combinations in I/O port, then access the vendor id, if the vendor id is all 1 bit, signales if there is no device in that adr.
- **Header** bit 7=1 indicates a multifunction device.
    - only this bit is 1 it make sence to adress all the function id

![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%203.png)

- The device can be
activated and
deactivated via the
**Command** register.
- **status** register : where device can signaled, the initialization is ok….
- **Base address registers:** Here we can define which address ranges the unit uses. At the same time, the device announces the (address) space it needs.
    - that is the way where configured device can use specific mem or I/O adr for the input/ outpur actual usage for the device driver. at boot time in PCI bios configure, allows u using all port starting at 100-107H
    - at the same time this register can also be read, which kinds of add ranges the device request.
        - e.g. device request 1 i/o range sized 8 I/ O Port, OS figured if this range free.
    - forced alignment: lower bits are 0, start with some arbitary adrs but have to be aligned.
        - e.g for device request 32 bytes of mem I/ O space adr has to be aligned at 32 byte adr
- **INT PIN/ INT LINE : which intr can this device allowed to use**

# PCI from an Operating-System Perspective

## PCI Initialization

- Before PCI devices can be accessed by their device drivers, which can be identified by the vendor id or device id(automatic). device driver in linux annonce a list of this vendor and device ids.

- following steps have to be taken:
    - Configure devices’ base address registers
        - device request for 32 I/O ports
    - Configure PCI Bridges
        - PCI BUS is actually a hierachy of buses. On the bus domain exists bridges, bridges connect to other PCI buses, this is a whole tree. All this bridges in this hierachy have to be configured with the adr ranges of all devices below their subtree
        - Base address registers – depend on devices “below”!
            - e.g. there are 2 PCI devices on that subordinate bus, 1. device has mem i/o range from 10 - 11 MB in mem adr space, and another device has range from 11-12 MB. So the PCI bridge need to be configured in the way that the mem range from 10-12 MB is below it. So the request form top can go the right subtree
        - Bus numbers (Primary, Secondary, Subordinate)
            - look the ex below
        - Subordinate is the number of the last downstream bus of this bridge(i.e., “below” a bridge are all buses numbered #secondary to #subordinate)
- BIOS or OS must explore and initialize the PCI bus structure step by step
    - Bus numbers and address ranges must never be allocated twice

## Exampel : PCI Initialization in Linux

- Step 1: Scan for buses
    - Initially we only konw that there is a host bridge and bus 0
        
        ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - We find devices on **bus 0**.
        - while PCI configuration space we figure out which decvices are these, and for each of these devices we figured out there are special values for some of regs in PCI configuration space are standarlized and tell us this is a PCI bridge
        - so now we can asure that this PCI device is a bridge(Bridge 1)
    - We initialize **bridge 1** and temporarily set its **subordinate** number to **0xff.**
        
        ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - We find devices on **bus 1**. We initialize **bridge 2** and temporarily set its **subordinate** number to **0xff.**
        
        ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%206.png)
        
    - We find devices on **bus 2**. As there are no more bridges, the **subordinate** number can conclusively be set to 2.
        - **subordinate**  defines what is max bus nr below that bridge.
        
        ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - We continue on **bus 1** with **bridge 3**. The new bus gets the next number (3). We temporarily set the **subordinate** number to **0xff.**
        
        ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%208.png)
        
    - On **bus 3** there is another **bridge (4)**. We initialize it and scan bus 4.
    
    ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%209.png)
    
    - As no further buses exist, we can conclusively set the remaining subordinate numbers.
        
        ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- Step 2 : assign addresses (OS does)
    - Algorithm:
        - once the buses are congfigued and all bridges konw where they are, I can contact all devices and then
            - e.g. Align the current I/O and memory addresses to the nearest 4 kiB respectively 1 MiB boundary
        - For each device on the current bus (in ascending order of I/O address-space requests):
            - Reserve I/O and memory addresses
            - Update the global I/O and memory pointers
            - Initialize and activate the device
        - Recursively apply the algorithm for all connected bridges
        - Align resulting addresses (see above)
        - Program and activate the bridge

## The PCI BIOS

### The PCI BIOS – Overview

- Configures PCI bridges and devices at boot time
    - minimally if a “Plug & Play” operating system is installed
    - otherwise completely
- After booting, the PCI BIOS allows …
    - searching for PCI devices by device class or type
    - accessing the configuration space
- Access via
    - BIOS interrupt 0x1a (Real Mode)
    - the “BIOS32 Service Directory” (Protected Mode)

### The PCI BIOS – in Protected Mode

- The BIOS32 Service Directory (in principle) allows to access arbitrary BIOS components.
- It is located somewhere in the range 0xE0000–0xFFFFF:
    
    ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%2011.png)
    
- With the BIOS32 service you can test whether a PCI BIOS is available.

# PCI Extensions and Successors

## AGP

### Accelerated Graphics Port – Hardware

- AGP, 1997: fast 1:1 connection of one (3D) graphics adapter

![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%2013.png)

### AGP – Initialization

- AGP adapter and bridge present themselves to the system
like a PCI-to-PCI bridge and a normal PCI device
    - full software compatibility
- Special AGP registers can be accessed through the capability list in the configuration space:
    
    ![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%2014.png)
    

## PCI-X

- Allows for higher bandwidth at full compatibility
    - The PCI-X bus uses the configuration of the slowest device
- Besides the increased clock frequency: Split Transactions
    - allow read tp overlap

## PCI Express

- technically has little to do with the original PCI bus
- Bi-directional, serial, point-to-point connections
- 直接看slides吧

## HyperTransport

- (AMD) CPU integrates memory controller and L2 cache
- Standardized communication with North Bridge
- integrate the formally seperate as 2 caches  and mem controller into the cpu.

![Untitled](week-11%20f4fb3e93cf394d06af9431058e4edb29/Untitled%2015.png)

- Bi-directional, point-to-point, links with 2–32 bits, clocked up to 3.2 GHz (DDR)
- Device configuration like with PCI
- Further uses aside from FSB replacement
    - Inter-CPU communication
    - Chipset communication (Northbridge Southbridge)
    - Communication with co-processors: HTX
- NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Architecture) : P33
    - each cpu has its own bunch to main mem
