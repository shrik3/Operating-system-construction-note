# Lecture

## Interrupt

- why we need Interrupt?
    - Overlapped I/O: meant that multiple I/O transfers (normally each I/O to a different device) could occur at the same time (like concurrent reads from tape and writes to disk).
    - Time sharing : if u want a time-intr to allow OS to preempt processes, they have to share time slices. OS also need to have the capability to run certain time-driven activities

## Prioritization mechanism

### Problem

- decided which interrupt is more 'important', when multi interrupt were signaled at once.
- while the CPU handles the most important request, further requests can be signaled.

### Solution:Prioritization mechanism

make sure the most important request be handled firstly.

- SW: CPU has one IRQ (interrupt request) line and queries/services devices in a specific order.
- HW: using a circuit to assign priorities to devices and handling the most urgent request.
- static priorities : each device is assigend a priority
- dynamic priorities

## Lost interrupts

- why would INTERRUPT LOST happend?
    1. The CPU cannot handle new interrupts, wenn interrupts are disabled(during interrupt handling)
    2. the Memory for IRQ is NOT enough for all interrupts.
- Solution here:
    - saving Memory space by making short interrupt handler routine as short as possible.
        - 1 bit storage for the pic, but it cannot store more than 1 intr, so when the second intr comes in, it gets lost
    - The interrupt should not be disabled for longer than the CPU needs.
        - reable in some point(talk in intr synchronization)
    - When an interrupt signals more than one I/O operation, the device driver should do sth to solve.
        - keyboard driver should never assume there is only 1 character in the input buffer just bucause there was  1 intr
        - defensively programming: have a loop to check the data for example in the keyboard buffer

## Interrupt Dispatch

- Interrupt dispatching is a mechanism wherein the CPU passes execution control to software to decide which device is triggered the inerrupt.
- Problem here:
    - Sequential querying : contact each device one by one to check which device triggers the intr, and dispatch the OS for the device problem that is responsible for this device.
        - time comsuming
        - state of I/O buses and other uninvolved devices might be modified.
- Solution : Interruppt vector
    - Interruppt vector : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_vector_table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_vector_table)
    - The system program must maintain an interrupt vector table, and each table entry records the address of an interrupt service program (ISR).
    - When an external event or exception is generated, the hardware will generate an interrupt flag. The CPU can based on the interrupt flag to get the interrupt vector number, queries the interrupt vector table (based on the address and interrupt vector number of the interrupt vector table) to obtain the address of the interrupt program for the corresponding interrupt number, and further executes the corresponding interrupt handler.
    - the number(index) is assigned to each intr, this index sometimes is related to the priority,but doesn’t have to be.
    - in practice, device may have to share a vector nr(intr chainning)
    - CPU-specific vetor-table structure
        - usually contain pointer to the func, rarely machine instruction.

## Saving State

- after all the handler routine return to the point where the program stopped(normal context)
- Transparency: Interrupt handling should not be noticed by the ctrl flow that interruptted, imaging you have a loop to calculate some of numbers and stores immidiate value into eax or rax register, suddenly a intr comes in and after returns the value of rax register value you used as temporary value is overwritten. for any ctrl flow that could be interrupted by intr handler, you must make sure that ctrl flow doesnot noticed there was a intr. it will be noticed cuz the time changed a little bit. besides time other states should stay the same.
- Solution:
    - HW
        - saving the essential state (return adr & status register)
        - automatic restored by special instruction IRET(interrupt return), RTE:
    - SW
        - intr may happend at any time → handler routine also must save and restore state

## Nested Interrupt Handling

- INTR can be also interrrupted by other INTR with higher priority. This enables the system to prioritize interrupts and reduce the latency of high priority events. which means INTR handler should be interruptible.
- avoiding unlimited nesting --> stack will grow while we are writting some other data structure and may be overflow....
- Solution:
    - CPU inly allows INTR with higher prio.
    - saving current priority of INTR in status reg
    - previous prior. on a stack

## Multiprocessor Systems

- Problem :
    - decided which CPU should be used to handle current INTR when the system is Multiprocessor system.
    - Inter-processor interrupts (IPIs): In multi-processor systems, the operating system needs to coordinate operations among multiple processors.
- Solution:
    - More complex interrupt-handling hardware for multiprocessors
        - static destination(e. g cpu1 always handles timer intr)
        - random destination
        - programmable destination
        - destination depending on current CPU load
        … and combinations thereof.

## Hazard

### Spurious Interrupts

- Interrupt-handling mechanism can be presented with spurious* interrupts, caused e.g. by Hardware errors or incorrectly programmed devices
- Solution: Programming the operating system to predict Spurious Interrupts

### Interrupt Storms

- [thrashing:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)) **thrashing** occurs when a computer's [virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) resources are overused, leading to a constant state of [paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging) and [page faults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_fault), inhibiting most [application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software)-level processing.
- High interrupt frequency can overload or “freeze” a computer
- Cause: spurious intrs or high i/o load
- solution : Detect interrupt storms or Deactivate responsible device
