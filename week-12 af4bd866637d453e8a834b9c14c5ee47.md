# L12 Device Drivers

# Importance of Device Drivers

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled.png)

- arch corespond: everything is specific for the hardware architecture.
- In Linux (3.1.10), driver code is 50 times larger than “kernel” code
    - Windows supports much more devices …
- Driver support is a critical factor for an OS’s acceptance!
    - Why else is Linux more popular than other free UNIXes?
- Significant amount of manpower is in device drivers
- I/O subsystem design requires much expertise
    - As much reusable functionality as possible in driver infrastructure
    - Well-defined driver structure, behavior and interfaces, i.e. a driver model

# Requirements

- Resource-preserving device usage
    - Work fast
    - Save energy
    - Save memory, ports, interrupt vectors
- we want to driver to have Uniform access mechanism → cuz appl in the end wants to interact with like network-card don#t want to have diffrent implementation for diffrent kind of network-card
    - **Minimal set of operations** for different device types
        - network-card : read, set the networking adr and send,receive package
    - **Powerful operations** for diverse application types
- Also device-specific access functions
    - stuff like only 1 or 2 device on the markt support, u want to able to use them.
- Activation and deactivation at runtime
    - e.g unplug some device → free mem
- Generic power-management interface
    - perserve energie

## Linux – Uniform Access

- for linux everything is file

```cpp
echo "Hello world" > /dev/ttyS0

- echo: print the parameter text
- /dev/ttyS0 : Serial Port Terminal
```

- communication via serial interface , in linux the serial interface is repressented by these device file.
- general idea: most device are accessable through file system.
- Pros:
    - System calls for file access (open, read, write, close) can be used for other I/O
    - Access permissions can be controlled via **file-system mechanisms**
    - Applications see no difference between files and “device files”
- Problems
    - Block-oriented devices must be adapted to byte stream
        - character devices : serial interface
        - [block device](https://www.cnblogs.com/qlee/archive/2011/07/27/2118406.html)
    - Some devices hardly fit this schema
        - Example: 3D graphics adapter
- diffrent way to access device in linux
    - Blocking input/output (normal case)
        - read: Process blocks until requested data is available
            - e.g the block has been read from hard disk, or they have some bytes in serial line, until requested data is available we blocks.
        - write: Process blocks until writing is possible
            - e.g the serial line has limited throughput which is configurable. writing blocks as long as the buffer between the appl and device is full.
    - Non-blocking input/output
        - open/read/write with additional flag O_NONBLOCK
            - leads to directly reading and writing kernel buffers, the system kenel must repeat systemcall later.
        - Instead of blocking, read and write return -EAGAIN
        - Caller may/must repeat the operation later
    - Asynchronous input/output
        - aio_(read|write|...) (POSIX 1003.1-2003) and io_uring (2019)
        - Indirectly via child process (fork/join)
            - let child process to do input/output, and at the later point wait child process to make sure that input/ouput are actually happend
        - System calls select, poll

## Windows – Uniform Access

- Devices are Executive kernel objects

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%201.png)

- win32 appl can call the the usual system call like CreateFile,ReadFile… and accesses the COM1, the device name COM1 is  equiavalent to the ttys0 (the first serial device) and the win32 subsystem is able to handle these DOS compatiable device name
- A COM will need the infomation is attached to the Win32PCB, PCB holds information in which theyre  subtree of the executive internal device tree. these device can be found.
- when the actual system calls to the NT kernel, the NTA exective are made, the info is passed on to have a translation from COM1 to this subpath in the comm decice tree and
- in NT kernel we have device subtree
    - GLOBAL, aliases that point to the actual device object in the NT kernel internel device tree
- these device can also be accessed  by NT kernel Native appls, using the same syscalls and the actual path through these devices on the left hand
- The point is: device access in win is similar to in linux,
    - the device tree is in the kernel,
    - not visible in the file system,
    - have name, path that can be traversed to access these devices.
- Synchronous or asynchronous input/output
    - WINDOWS has a tradition of being asyschronous by default, that is  actually a parameter here of the ReadFile syscall called LPOVERLAPPED, and if the para is now, we get a synchronous blocking read blocking and otherwise u cannot pointer to a data structure, that is a part of the appl process and later u can request the status info on that  overlapped input/ output.
    
    ![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%202.png)
    
- More features:
    - I/O with timeout
    - WaitForMultipleObjects – wait for one or more kernel objects
        - File handles, semaphores, mutex, thread handle, …
        - also the way wait for io to complete
        - in linux(select, poll)
    - I/O Completion Ports
        - used for thread pools
            - u have N thread that want to wait for M ongoging input outputs. you can use these I/O Completion Ports to have threads form thread poll handling incoming or finished io.
                - e.g 1 job form the user is arrives, 1 thread is woken up.
        - Activation of a waiting thread after I/O operation

## Linux – Device-specific Functions

- there are sth u want to do with the device but it simply donnot fit into that interface.
    - e. g for serial line would be to configure the throughput. the frequency u can put bits on that line is pretty device specific.
- done by linux using iocontrol: ioctl:
    
    ![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - the value of the para, what does this para means and how they structued is completely device specific.
        - look up the documentation e.g for the serial driver
- Generic interface, device-specific semantics:
    - so u give it a request nr and the request nr is device specific, and then u can add an arbitray nr of para.

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%205.png)

- using these sysy file system u can actually explore what device u have in ur system, the information of ur device, read attributes of these devices and control these devices
- The device model allows kernel and applications to explore the
available hardware. For example, power management can stop
and restart dependent devices in the correct order

## Windows – Device-specific Functions

- DeviceIoControl corresponds to UNIX ioctl:

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%206.png)

- What else?
    - All devices and drivers are represented by kernel objects
        - Special system calls allow to explore this name space
    - Static configuration via Registry
    - Dynamic configuration e.g. via WMI
        - Windows Management Instrumentation to expolore device in system

# I/O-System Structure

- to build a io subsystem, one way is to have drivers with different interface for each.
- **Drivers with different interfaces …**
    
    ![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%207.png)
    
- on top we have device uses independent i/o funktions, and the resulting i/o request are then handed down to the drivers, and the drivers access hardware though a thin layer providing hardware access function. in oostubs is ioport class. this layer talks to the hardware devices.
- The communication backup usually by the intr, if someone press a key u will get an intr, the intr endsup in the hardware-access layer and this layer hands the intr info using some kind of callback add to the driver, the driver may signal the io completion to the upper layers.

- if each device has a device specific interface : allow to fully utilize all device properties but that means the decive-independent layer are not independent anymore, it must be extend when it’s necessary.
- necessitate extending the I/O system for each driver(for device specific)
    - Large variety of devices high efforts(when we have many different drivers)
    - Unrealistic: The OS is there first, then the drivers.

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%208.png)

- enable a (dynamically) extensible I/O system
- allow flexibly “stacking” device drivers
    - Virtual devices
    - Filters
- driver model
    
    ![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%209.png)
    
- A list of expected driver functions
    - what function call be called from the top or buttom, e.g intr coming form the hardware also necessitate callback.
- Definition of optional and mandatory functions
- Functions the driver may use
- Interaction protocols
    - which func must be called before which one
    - intialize some hardware sucessor before use
- Synchronization schema and functions
    - if the interaction with these interfaces touches kernel state, u need to make sure the consistency is maintained
- Definition of driver classes if multiple interface types are inevitable
    - driver class serial communication device
    - driver class sound card
    - driver class networking card
    - driver class block device

# Device Drivers and Environment

## Device-driver Requirements

- A central requirments of devicer driver is that it must be able to manage multiple devices
- Allow assigning device files
- Management of multiple device instances
- Operations:
    - Hardware detection
    - Initialization and termination
    - Reading and writing of data
        - possibly [scatter/gather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectored_I/O)
    - Control operations and device status
        - e.g. via ioctl or virtual file system
    - Power management
- Internal challenges:
    - Synchronization
    - Buffering
    - Requesting needed system resources

### Linux – Driver Template: Operations

- if a use call open/dev/dummy_device/open then the kernels driver infrastructure calls dummy_open, it passes inode of the device file that was opend. Using file *instance the device driver can distinguish between multiple processes have opened the same device file.
- if a user process has opend this device, this device cannow  be read by using the standard syscall, the dummy_read was called.
- copy_to_user : copy a piece of data to somewhere in the user addr space(buffer), the user specific when she called that read syscall
- struct file_operation: used to announcing the existing interfaces of the driver to the driver infrastructure.
    - .open holds a pointer to a function that the infrastructure may call, if there is a open from the outside on that device file
    - dummy_open : announce that id someone calls open we want to have dummy_open called

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%2011.png)

- **Linux – Driver Template: Registration**
    - how driver register itself
    - every driver module has to have a initialiyation and a exit function. this is announed using these macros here

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%2012.png)

### Linux – Driver Infrastructur

- Allocate and release resources
    - Memory, ports, IRQ vectors, DMA channels
- Hardware access
    - Read and write ports and memory blocks
- Dynamically allocate memory
    - for buffers foe example
- Blocking and waking processes
    - Wait queues
- Registering interrupt handlers
    - Low-level → prolog
    - Tasklets for longer activities → more or less epilog
        - runs on software intr context L1/2
- Special APIs for different driver classes
    - Character devices, block devices, USB devices, network interface cards
- Integration in proc or sys file system

### Windows – I/O System

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%2013.png)

- **WMI(windows management instrumentation)**: a uniform way to instrument and monitor events in the kernel and monitor perfermance
- **PNP(plug and play**): e. g plug in a USB → pnp manager talks to the user mode part that pops up some kind of dialogue to asks u to insert a driver CD, 现在都是自动在微软下载。
- this driver comes with a **setup components**:
    - **.inf** (driver installation file): matadata e.g
        - which devices this driver for
        - what properities does this driver have
        - which file s are part of this driver
        - which registry entries have to be entered to the registry
        - which IDs the driver have (vendor id, device id)
    - **.cat(catalog file that primarily holds hashed over all files that comes with dricer)**
        - the cat file is usually cryptographically signed, so u can make sure that the device vendor is authentic.
- registry:
    - can be accessed by the I/O manager,
- I/O manager controls input and output using the drivers here

### Windows – Driver Structure

- The I/O system controls the driver using the …
    - Initialization/unload routine
        - called after/before loading/unloading the driver
    - Routine for adding devices
        - PnP manager found a new devices for the driver
    - Dispatch routines
        - Open, close, read, write, and device-specific operations
    - Interrupt Service Routine
        - called from the central interrupt dispatch routine →prologue
    - DPC routine (deferred procedure call)
        - Interrupt-handling “epilogue”
    - I/O completion and cancel routines
        - Information on the status of forwarded I/O jobs

### Windows – Typical I/O Procedure

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%2014.png)

1. NtWriteFile(file_handle, char_buffer)
    - pass a file_handle and a char_buffer that is suppose to be written into file.
    - find the actual file system and the responsible driver form the file_handle
2. contact the responsible driver to write data in current buffer in specific position.

 6. filter driver :  actually talks to the both hard disk via the lower disk driver

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%2015.png)

### Windows – I/O Request Packets

![Untitled](week-12%20af4bd866637d453e8a834b9c14c5ee47/Untitled%2016.png)

- once u initiate an IO operation, the IO manager creates and initialialzes an IRP.
- IRP is actually a stack, and each driver level(file-system driver, rate filter driver, disk driver) gets a new level in the stack and stores its intermediate state here, especially infomation which method must be called on completion of that io request
- in this example we had the io manager automatically calling completion routines(3, 4), and the info which ones there are is all stores in this IRP

# Summary

- A good I/O subsystem design is essential
    - I/O interface
    - Driver mode
    - Driver infrastructure
    - Interfaces should remain stable for a long time.
- Goal: Effort minimization for drivers
- Windows has a mature I/O system
    - “Everything is a kernel object”
    - Asynchronous I/O operations are central
- Linux has been catching up in the last few years
    - “Everything is a file”
    - sysfs and asynchronous I/O (io_uring!) were added later
