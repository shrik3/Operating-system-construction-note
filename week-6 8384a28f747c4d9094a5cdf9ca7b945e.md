# Lecture :The Programming Model of the
x86-64 Architecture

## Basic Programming Model

### 8086: Programming Model

- 16-bit architecture, little endian: more significant 8 bits are seted in higher mem address
- 20-bit address bus(max. 1 MiB memory addressable)
- few register
- 123 instructions
    - non-orthogonal instruction set: not all instructions can used to any register.→compiler hard to implementent
- Opcode lengths of 1 to 4 bytes
- Segmented memory
- 8086: Register file

    - AX: Accumulator Register
        - can be used to arithmetic logical operations/ I/O and is shortest machine code
    - BX: Base Address Register
    - CX: Counter Register
        - Used for LOOP, string operations with REP, and bit-shift and rotate
    - DX: Data Register
        - MUL/DIV  use DX: AX.
        - port Nr for IN and OUT
    - SI, DI: Index Register
        - for array accesses (displaacement)
    - BP: Base Pointer
- 8086: Segment Memory
    - logical addresses on 8086 consist of segment selector and offset
        - segment selector : the value of a segment register
        
        ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%201.png)
        
        - offset : from general-purpose register or instruction
    - Segment selector(16 bit)<< 4 + offset(16 bit) = Physical address(20 bit)
    - able to address 1MiB(20 bit) in spite of 16 bit architecture
- **8086: Memory Models:**
    - Tiny:
        - Code, data and stack segments are identical
        - 64 kiB in total
    - Small
        - Code separated from data & stack
        - 64 kiB + 64 kiB
    - Medium
        - 32- (or rather 20-) bit “far” pointers for code
        - 16 bit “near” pointers for data & stack (fixed 64 kiB segment)
    - Compact
        - 16-bit “near” pointers for code (fixed 64-kiB segment)
        - 32- (20-) bit “far” pointers for data & stack
    - Large
        - “far” pointers for everything – 1 MiB completely usable
    - Huge
        - like “large”, but with normalized pointers

- 8086: Conclusion
    - + first PC’s CPU and still compatible
    - + 1 MiB of memory in spite of 16-bit architecture(normally 20 bits)
    - + Segments separate logical modules in memory.
    - -Difficult program and compiler development:different memory models, non-orthogonal instruction set

- **IA-32: Intel’s 32-bit Architecture**
    - 32-bit technology: Registers, data and address bus
        - starting with Pentium Pro: 64-bit data and 36-bit address bus
    - more registers
    - Complex support for protection and multitasking
        - Protected Mode→ PROTECT RING
        - originally introduced with the 80286 (16 bit)
    - Compatibility
        - with older operating systems through Real Mode
        - with older applications through Virtual 8086 Mode
    - Segment-based programming model
    - Page-based MMU
    
- amd64 / x86-64 – 64-Bit AMD/Intel Arch
    - IA-32 was limited to max. 4 GiB virtual memory
    - Solution: 64-bit architecture
        - register has 64 bits but addresses don’t.→Currently 48-bit virtual address space (up to 256 TiB)
    - more registers(and wide 64 bits)
    - memory protection in Page-based programming model
        - X(excuteable) bit for individual bit
        - nearly no segmentation
    - Still backwards compatible
        - Long Mode for putting the new features to use
        - 32-bit Legacy Mode for systems or individual applications
    - Developed by AMD, adopted by Intel (as “Intel 64”)
    
    ### Register File(extentions)

    ### x86-64: Register File (Additions)

    ### Memory Management and Addressing
    
    ### x86-64: Addressing Modes
    
- Effective addresses := BASE-REG +(INDEX-REG * Scale) + Displacement
    
    ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%205.png)
    
- MOV RAX, array[RSI * 4] Read from array with 4-byte elements, using RSI as index
- New with x86-64: IP-relative addressing
    - Effective addresses := RIP + Displacement
- [The A20 Gate](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/A20-Gate)
- IA-32: Protected Mode – Segments
    - A program consists of multiple mem segments
        - normally at least CODE, DATA, STACK
        - Segment selectors describe add. and size
    - Linear address := start add + EA
        
        ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%206.png)
        
        - Paging unit is disabled → Corresponds to physical address
        - Segments may overlap, e.g. start addresses == 0
        - In practice, such a “flat address space” is often used
    - No segment-based protection in Long Mode
- IA-32 / x86-64: Segments

### x86-64: Page-based MMU

- Demand paging: only load pages that are demanded by the excuting process.
- 80386: Paging Unit(PU) can be enabled optionally
- Configured via ctrl register CR0/2/3

### x86-64: Page Table

![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%209.png)

x86-64 :TLB

- Indirection via to much page levels may slow down memory accesses.
- Solution: the Translation Lookaside Buffer(TLB)
- TLB is an associative cache consist of
    - tag: all level of virtual add.(PML4/PDP/PD/PI)
    - data: Page frame address
- high hit rate of 98%
- Writing CR3 invalidates the TLB
    - TLB tags include 12-bit process-context ID (PCID) since intel Westmere(2010)

### Protection on IA-32

- Protection Rings and Gates
    
    ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%2010.png)
    
- prority rules:
    - calling code in outer ring 🙅🏻‍♀️
    - calling code in an inner ring: only via gates
    - calling code in the same ring ✅
    - access to data of an outer ring ✅
    - access to data of an inner ring 🙅🏻‍♀️
    - access to data in the same ring ✅

- [Segment Descriptors](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2010/readings/i386/s05_01.htm)

### Protection on X86-64

- x86 Protection is achived via virtual mem
    - process only see its virtual add space
- Page-Table Entries
    - Setting possible in all hierachy levels
        - Data must not be executed ad code(NX bit)
        - Protection from read (U/S): from ring 3 with lowest priority
        - read only pages(R/W=0)
    - shared mem is allowed/read-only access
- effective→only ring kernel and applocation are separated.

### tasks

- IA-32: Multitasking: segment for every task is seperated (certical and horizontal)

![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%2012.png)

- [Task-State-Segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment)
    - Task Reg(TR) points to TSS
    - on IA-32: storage space for task state
        - segments, reg contents
        - task switches possible in hardware
    - not in x86 long mode
        - not everz task is allowed to do I/O
        -
