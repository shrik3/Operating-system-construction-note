# Lecture :The Programming Model of the
x86-64 Architecture

## Basic Programming Model

- 8086: Programming Model
    - 16-bit architecture, little endian: more significant bits are seted in higher mem address
    - 20-bit address bus
    - few register
    - 123 instructions
        - non-orthogonal instruction set: not all instructions can used to any register.→hard compiler
    - Opcode lengths of 1 to 4 bytes
    - Segmented memory
- 8086: Register file
    
    ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled.png)
    
    - AX: Accumulator Register
        - can be used to arithmetic logical operations/ I/O and is shortest machine code
    - BX: Base Address Register
    - CX: Counter Register
        - Used for LOOP, string operations with REP, and bit-shift and rotate
    - DX: Data Register
        - MUL/DIV  use DX: AX.
        - port Nr for IN and OUT
    - SI, DI: Index Register
        - for array accesses (displaacement)
    - BP: Base Pointer
- 8086: Segment Memory
    - logical addresses on 8086 consist of segment selector and offset
        - segment selector : the value of a segment register
        
        ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%201.png)
        
        - offset : from general-purpose register or instruction
    - Segment selector(16 bit)<< 4 + offset(16 bit) = Physical address(20 bit)
    - able to address 1MiB(20 bit) in spite of 16 bit architecture
- 8086: Memory Models:
    - Tiny:
        - Code, data and stack segments are identical
        - 64 kiB in total
    - Small
        - Code separated from data & stack
        - 64 kiB + 64 kiB
    - Medium
        - 32- (or rather 20-) bit “far” pointers for code
        - 16 bit “near” pointers for data & stack (fixed 64 kiB segment)
    - Compact
        - 16-bit “near” pointers for code (fixed 64-kiB segment)
        - 32- (20-) bit “far” pointers for data & stack
    - Large
        - “far” pointers for everything – 1 MiB completely usable
    - Huge
        - like “large”, but with normalized pointers

- 8086: Conclusion
    - + first PC’s CPU and still compatible
    - + 1 MiB of memory in spite of 16-bit architecture(normally 20 bits), Segments separate logical modules in memory.
    - -Difficult program and compiler development:different memory models, non-orthogonal instruction set

- IA-32: Intel’s 32-bit Architecture
    - 32-bit technology: Registers, data and address bus
        - starting with Pentium Pro: 64-bit data and 36-bit address bus
    - more registers
    - Complex support for protection and multitasking
        - Protected Mode(week-7)
        - originally introduced with the 80286 (16 bit)
    - Compatibility
    - Segment-based programming model
    - Page-based MMU
    
- amd64 / x86-64 – 64-Bit AMD/Intel Arch
    - IA-32 was limited to max. 4 GiB virtual memory
    - Solution: 64-bit architecture
        - register has 64 bit but addresses don’t.→Currently 48-bit virtual address space (up to 256 TiB)
    - memory protection in Page-based programming model
        - X(excuteable) bit for individual bit
        - nearly no segmentation
    - Still backwards compatible
    - Developed by AMD, adopted by Intel (as “Intel 64”)
    - Register File

    ### Memory Management and Addressing
    
- x86-64: Addressing Modes
    - Effective addresses := BASE-REG +(INDEX-REG * Scale) + Displacement
        
        ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - MOV RAX, array[RSI * 4] Read from array with 4-byte elements, using RSI as index
    - New with x86-64: IP-relative addressing
        - Effective addresses := RIP + Displacement
- [The A20 Gate](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/A20-Gate)
- IA-32: Protected Mode – Segments
    - A program consists of multiple mem segments
        - normally at least CODE, DATA, STACK
        - Segment selectors describe add. and size
    - Linear address := start add + EA
        
        ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%205.png)
        
        - Paging unit is disabled → Corresponds to physical address
        - Segments may overlap, e.g. start addresses == 0
        - In practice, such a “flat address space” is often used
    - No segment-based protection in Long Mode
- IA-32 / x86-64: Segments
    
    ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%206.png)
    

### x86-64: Page-based MMU

- Demand paging: only load pages that are demanded by the excuting process.
- 80386: Paging Unit(PU) can be enabled optionally
- Configured via ctrl register CR0/2/3

![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%207.png)

### x86-64: Page Table

![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%208.png)

x86-64 :TLB

- Indirection via to much page levels may slow down memory accesses.
- Solution: the Translation Lookaside Buffer(TLB)
- TLB is an associative cache consist of
    - tag: all level of virtual add.(PML4/PDP/PD/PI)
    - data: Page frame address
- high hit rate of 98%
- Writing CR3 invalidates the TLB
    - TLB tags include 12-bit process-context ID (PCID) since intel Westmere(2010)

### Protection on IA-32

- Protection Rings and Gates
    
    ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%209.png)
    
- prority rules:
    - calling code in outer ring 🙅🏻‍♀️
    - calling code in an inner ring: only via gates
    - calling code in the same ring ✅
    - access to data of an outer ring ✅
    - access to data of an inner ring 🙅🏻‍♀️
    - access to data in the same ring ✅

- [Segment Descriptors](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2010/readings/i386/s05_01.htm)

### Protection on X86-64

- x86 Protection is achived via virtual mem
    - process only see its virtual add space
- Page-Table Entries
    - Setting possible in all hierachy levels
        - Data must not be executed ad code(NX bit)
        - Protection from read (U/S): from ring 3 with lowest priority
        - read only pages(R/W=0)
    - shared mem is allowed/read-only access
- effective→only ring kernel and applocation are separated.

### tasks

- IA-32: Multitasking: segment for every task is seperated (certical and horizontal)

![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%2011.png)

- [Task-State-Segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment)
    - Task Reg(TR) points to TSS
    - on IA-32: storage space for task state
        - segments, reg contents
        - task switches possible in hardware
    - not in x86 long mode
        - not everz task is allowed to do I/O
        - 

# Task 4

## Overview

- Coroutine : involve context switching
    - asm code : save the context of a coroutine and restoring context into another coroutine
    - each coroutine must know which coroutine is next one and which is running now
- Dispatcher : remembers which coroutine is current activ one
- Scheuler : has ready list contains all ready-to-run coroutines and pick the first one from the queue and dispatch it.
- toc : holding the context for the coroutine.

## x86-64 Assembler Programming

- What is an Assembler?
    - :Component between compiler and linker, compiler to transform code of an assembler program to machine code
    
    ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%2012.png)
    
- What is an assembler capable of?
    - Understands only a few complex expressions
        - input language corresponds to CPU instruction set!
        - simple calculations and preprocessing at assenbly time
    - Higher programming languages are translated to simpler instructions by the compiler:
- What is a Register?
    - Extremely fast, very small storage within the CPU that can (in x86-64 CPUs) store 64 bits
    - Compiler: Mapping of high-level language variables to
    storage locations in the data/BSS segment of an object file
    - Calculations with variables: Usually beforehand loading memory register necessary
- Memory
    - Access via addresses
    - way slow than register
    - ax :16 bit (ah + al)
    - eax : 32 bit
    - rax : 64 bit
- The Stack : Temporary LIFO storage for values “as long as they are needed”
- Addressing Modes
- Functions

![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%2013.png)

## Part a) Coroutine

- Cooperative Thread Switch
    
    ![Untitled](week-6%208384a28f747c4d9094a5cdf9ca7b945e/Untitled%2014.png)
    
- Functions
    - **Coroutine (void* tos);**
        - In the coroutine constructor, the register values are initialized so that the stack pointer initially points to tos and on first activation execution begins with the kickoff function.
    - **void go ();**
        - This method is used for the first activation of the first coroutine in the system. Therefore no register values must be saved here.
    - **void resume (Coroutine& next)**
        - This method triggers a coroutine switch.
    - **virtual void action () = 0;**
        - = 0 mean pure virtual, the base class doesn’t has any implementation, derive class has to implemente the function.
        - The method action represents the actual job of the coroutine.

### **toc : pop out stack**

- Call from C++ necessitates declaration with extern "C"!
- Functions
    - Prepares the struct toc for the first activation.
    
    ```cpp
    void toc_settle (struct toc* regs, 
    void* tos,void (*kickoff)(void*, void*, …),
    void *coroutine);
    //tos : popout stack
    
    //creat a stack 
    char stack1[65536];
    //- how to pass tos pointer?
    //- Couroutine constructor only saves a tos pointer, so if we
    //  create a coroutine, we have a top of stack.
    Coroutine c1(
    stack1 + sizeof(stack1)            
    );
    
    void toc_settle (struct toc* regs, 
    void* tos,void (*kickoff)(void*, void*, …),
    void *coroutine){			
    //- how to put the cotourine pointer into the stack?
    //- make tos pointer point to void.
    
    //char *p; //0x1000
    //p++;     //0x1001
    //int *p2  //0x2000
    //p2++     //0x2008,32bit interger
    
    //void *p3
    //p3++;        //not standard cuz dk the size of void
    
    //point is cast the p to void **.
    void **p = (void **)tos
    p--;
    //p is a pointer which point to a pointer point to void
    *p = coroutine;
    }
    
    ```
    
    - Loads the non-volatile processor registers with the contents of the struct regs.
        
        ```cpp
        void toc_go (struct toc* regs);
        ```
        
    - Performs a context switch. To do this, the current register values in regs_now must be saved and replaced by the values of regs_then.
        - what has toc_settle done?
            1. saves the NV-R of the callee coroutine to its toc
            2. loads NV-R form another toc including stack pointer
                1. at this point sp point to new stack
            3.  returns to the top value of stack
        - and loads NV-R form another toc including stack pointer(at this point sp point to new stack), and then it returns.
        
        ```cpp
        
        void toc_switch (struct toc* regs_now, struct toc* regs_then);
        ```
        

## Part b) Dispatcher

- konws which coroutine is currently active(life pointer)
    - first para of toc_switch

### Scheduler

- Considers the set of ready threads
- The currently running thread is always also affected by the decision
- We pass the selected, new thread to the dispatcher.

### Dispatcher

- The dispatcher manages the life pointer, which indicates the currently active coroutine, and performs process switches.
    - **Dispatcher ()**
        - The constructor initializes the life pointer with null to indicate that no coroutine is known yet
    - **void go (Coroutine& first)**
        - With this method the coroutine first is put in the life pointer and started
    - **void dispatch (Coroutine& next)**
        - This method sets the life pointer to next and performs a coroutine switch from the old to the new life pointer
    - **Coroutine* active ()**
        - This can be used to determine which coroutine is currently in control of the processor.

## Part c) Cooperative Scheduling

- [use static_cast<Entrant *> to protect multiple inheritance class.](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/37445001)
- The scheduler manages the ready list (a private Queue member of this class), which is the list of processes of type Entrant that are ready to run. The list is processed from front to back. New processes, and those that yield the processor, are appended to the end of the list.
    - **void ready (Entrant& that)**
        - This method registers the process that with the scheduler. It is appended to the end of the ready list.
    - **void schedule ()**
        - This method starts up scheduling by removing the first process from the ready list and activating it
    - **void exit ()**
        - With this method a process can terminate itself. The scheduler does not append it again to the end of the ready list. Instead, it removes the first process from the ready list and activates it.
    - **void kill (Entrant& that)**
        - With this method a process can terminate another one (that). The process that is simply removed from the ready list and is thereby never scheduled again.
    - **void resume ()**
        - This method allows to trigger a context switch without the calling Entrant having to know which other Entrant objects exist in the system, and which of these should be activated. This decision is made by the scheduler using the entries in its ready list. In this system, it shall append the currently running process to the end of the ready list and activate the first one.

## ****Class Entrant****

- **Entrant (void* tos);**
    - The Entrant constructor passes only the tosparameter to the Coroutine constructor.

## Questions:

- [Scheduler::kill](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/6433e507db087fcf51c391aabd85db07b4cd018e/thread/scheduler.cc#L39)
    - kill should also can kill the thread itself.
- [main](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/6433e507db087fcf51c391aabd85db07b4cd018e/main.cc#L127)
    - appl should also been put into ready list
- ****[kickoff.cc](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/6433e507db087fcf51c391aabd85db07b4cd018e/thread/kickoff.cc#L29)****
    - scheduler.exit() instead infinite loop
