# **Lecture : Interrupts – Synchronization**

# some methods used to solve the synchrinization issue.

- One-sided synchronization → disable and enable interrupts, works with one-sided synchronization.
- only consume() can be interrupted.

- Conclusion : A→normal application ctrl flow, IH→interrupt handler
    - IH interrupt A
        - implicitly, at an arbitrary point
        - always higher priority, runs to completion
    - A disable IH
        - explicitly, with cli / sti
    - Synchronization / maintenance of consistency is one-sided

## Control-Flow Level Model

- Normal case
    - L0→A; L1→IH
    - Prio. L1 > L0

![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 162453.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_162453.png)

- Control flows of the same level are sequentialized
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 162919.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_162919.png)
    
    - multiple control flows on one level are ready,  they are
    executed sequentially
    - Arbitrary sequentialization strategy(FIFO; LIFO.....)
- Control flows can switch levels
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 164454.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_164454.png)
    
    - With cli an L0 control flow explicitly switches to L1
        - other ctrl flow on L1 in this case will be delayed
    - With sti an L1 control flow explicitly switches to L0
        - now the been delayed ctrl flow on L1 will finally get their trun to run
- Generalization to multiple interrupt levels:
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 165046.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_165046.png)
    
    - ctrl flows can be intertupted by ctrl flows on lower level(bigger Nr), never be interrupted by ctrl flows on higher level, and sequentialized by ctrl flows on the same level.
    - Control flows can switch levels by special operations (here: modifying the status register)
- how to maintain Consistency
    - Motivation : Each state variable is (logically) assigned
    to exactly one level Lf
        - for ctrl flows form the same level accesses →sequentialization
        - for ctrl flows form lower or higher level →maintain consistency
    - How to measures for maintaining consistency?
        - for ctrl flows from above → hard synchronization
        - for ctrl flows from below → onblocking synchronization

## Hard Synchronization

- pro and cons
    - + Maintains consistency : for complex data structures and access patterns also wroks and independent for compiler.
    - + Simple to use (for the developer), always works
    - - Broadband effect : delay all ctrl flows on lower level(bigger Nr)
    - - Priority violation : delay ctrl flows with high Prio.
    - - Pessimism .. 虽然中断概率很小，但是缺点太拉跨。
- Assessment
    - we should considerate the delay’s frequency, mean duration, maximum duration when it comes to significants of this mechanism. Maximum duration is the most critical thing cuz it directly influences the (to be expected) latency and Latency too high data can get lost which leads....
        - Interrupts aren’t noticed
        - Data is picked up too slowly from I/O devices
    - Conclusion:Hard synchronization is rather unsuitable
    for maintaining consistency of complex data structures

## Nonblocking Synchronization

### for Consumer-Producer-Problem:

![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 180104.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_180104.png)

- consume() generates a correct result even if during its
execution produce() was executed.
- Consistency condition:
    - The result of interrupt exec. (figure above)must be equal to an arbitrary sequential exec.(e.g  C() after or before P() )
- older version
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 185237.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_185237.png)
    
    - occupied is write by both sides
- new version 1
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 185836.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_185836.png)
    
    - but still 2 states readed by one side and writtenby other
        - nextout is written by C() and readed by P()
        - nextin : same
    - so we must check if it holds consistency condition
        - C() before reading nextin →P() before C()  ✅
        - C() after reading nextin →C() before P()     ✅
        - P() before reading nextout→P() before C() ✅
        - P() after reading nextout→C() before P()    ✅

### for system time

![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 192548.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_192548.png)

- Consistency condition:
    - The result of interrupt exec. must be equal to an arbitrary sequential exec.(e.g  time() after or before timerHanler() )
- Approach:
    1. read data and pretend we are not interrupted.
    2. check were we interrupted?
    3. if interrupted→return 1.
- new version
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 193033.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_193033.png)
    
    - pro and cons
        - + Maintains consistency :(by interrupt transparency)
        - + No priority violations (interrupts stay enabled!)
        - + No cost, or only in the (rare) conflict situation,
            - no cost →bounded-buffer example
            - in the conflict situation→optimistic approaches, system-time example (additional cost by restarting)
        - - Complexity
        - - Constraints
            - Tiny code changes can ruin the consistency guarantee
            - Compiler’s code generation must be taken into account
        - - Predictability
            - Costs for restart unpredictable for large amounts of data
    - Conclusion
        - the involved algorithm is a special solution for a special case. It is not suitable as a generally applicable measure.

## Prologue/Epilogue Model

- Motivation:
    - Hard synchronisation is simple and always works, but it has long delay when accessing state from the level with smaller Nr or modifying state in IH
    
    ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled.png)
    
    - caused by: the logical state stays in the HW interrupt level(figure above L1...LN)
- Solution
    
    ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - add another level named L½→ Epilogue Level
    - IH is divided into prologue and epilogue
        - Prologue runs on interrupt level L1...n
        - Epilogue runs on (software) level L½
            - State resides (as far as possible) on here
- Prologue
    - runs on hardware-interrupt level has the highest priority
    - short and modify few or no states
    - can request an epilogue on demand
- Epilogue
    - runs on additional control-flow level, being delay or not is depended on prologue
    - does the actual work
    - has access to most of the state.  State is synchronized on the epilogue level
- Implementation
    
    ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled%202.png)
    
    1. enter the epilogue level:  → corresponds to cli
    2. Interrupt is signaled on level L1, execute prologue.
    3. Prologue requests epilogue for delayed execution (relay).
    4. Prologue terminates, interrupted L½ control flow (application) continues.
    5. Application control flow leaves epilogue level L½ (leave), process meanwhile accumulated epilogues.
    6. Epilogue terminates, application control flow continues on L0
    - When do we have to process pending epilogues?
        - Just before the CPU returns to L0, While the application ctrl flow run on epilogue/processing epilogues/the CPU executed control flows on levels L1...n, epilogues may have accumulated.
- implementation options
    - AST(asynchronous system trap)
        - is an interrupt that can only be requested by software.
        - set a bit in a specific register
        - comparable to a HW interrupt
    - main difference to traps / exceptions / software interrupts:
        - AST is executed asynchronously
        - runs on L½ level(interrupt level), which is between L0 and  HW IH level.
    - AST can simplifies ensuring epilogues are processed
        - Processing in AST (automatically, before returning to L0)
        - what we need to do is manage pending epilogues
    
    ```cpp
    //L1 is now where AST been implemented
    //L2 is where HW intr start
    void enter() {
     CPU::setIRQL(1); // setting level to 1, delay AST
    }
    void leave() {
     CPU::setIRQL(0); // allow AST (pending
    } // AST would now be processed)
    void relay(<Epilogue>) {
     <enqueue epilogue in queue>
     CPU_SRC1::trigger(); // activate level-1 IRQ (AST)
    }
    void __attribute__((interrupt_handler)) irq1Handler() {
     while (<Epilogue in queue>) { 
     <dequeue epilogue from queue>
     <process epilogue>
    } }
    ```
    

- now we don’t need to disable hardware interrupts anymore, but we still need to considerate one issue about epilogue queue
    - when prologue runs and called relay(), we need to store the info in some sort of data structure(queue). when we excuted epilogue, we need to read and modify this queue, before we go back to L0, we need to process all pending epilogues and clear them again from queue, for accomplishing this we have 2 options here
        - Hard synchronisation or non blocking synchronisation →put queue on L1, and do Hard synchronisation when access this queue.
            - prologue calls relay(), realy() can modify queue cuz they are on the same level.
            - if we are on L1/2, every time we do dequeue, we have to do a short intr to go to L1 and modify the queue.
            
            ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled%203.png)
            
        - put queue on L1/2 and do some sort of nonblocking synchronization
            - enqueue can interrupt dequeue
- PROs and CONs
    - + Maintains consistency (synchronization on epilogue level)
    - + Programming model corresponds to the (easily understandable)model behind hard synchronization
    - Also complex state can be synchronized
        - without losing any IRQs
        - protect all kernel states
    - - Additional level———→ additional overhead
    - -Shared state between prologue and epilogue must still be synchronized hard or nonblockingly
- assessment
    - good compromise for synchronizing accesses to kernel state.
    - suitable for maintaining consistency of complex data structures.

# Task-3

## Pro/Epilogue Model

- what could happens when INTR been disabled all the time?
    - might lossing INTRs, you might have a INTR with a specific device(store into interrupts ctrl HW) and even have the sencond one and further , there were lost.
    - INTR latency can get really high
    - Assenment: acceptable when it’s been done quickly, probably not okay when the condition is more complexer.
- what happens in Pro/Epilogue Model
    - Previously
    1. application run on L0
    2. once you get INTR, you end up in IH level L1
    3. INTRs are automatically been disabled when get into L1 (what cpu does)
    4. trigger() runs in L1
    5. return back to L0 and meanwhiles enable INTR
    - Pro/Epilogue Model
        
        ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled%202.png)
        
        1. enter the epilogue level:  → corresponds to cli
        2. Interrupt is signaled on level L1, execute prologue.
        3. Prologue requests epilogue for delayed execution (relay).
        4. Prologue terminates, interrupted L½ control flow (application) continues.
        5. Application control flow leaves epilogue level L½ (leave), process meanwhile accumulated epilogues.
        6. Epilogue terminates, application control flow continues on L0.

# tip &tricks

- Queue Class : manage epilogue
    - ‘tail’ is a pointer to the ‘next’ pointer in the last element
- Epilogue queue
    - when is Access happend.
        - L1/2 call leave() : dequeue
        - prolog call relay() : enqueque
    - How to synchronize accesses?
        - easier: if we want to do hard synchronization we need to located queue on L1, when we want to access queue we need to switch to L1
        - non block synchronization: queue doesn’t break when enqueue is interrupt by enqueue, even more: when we in multilevel intr sys  we may have the situation enqueue is interrupted by enqueue.
- Guard::leave()
    - Which condition must hold when leaving
    this function?
        - there are no epilogue in queue→all epilogue was processed
            
            ```cpp
            While(1){
            	cli
            	e = q.dequeue();
            	sti
            	if(!e) {// valid pointer
            		break;
            	}
            	e.epilogue();// no problem cuz on L1/2
            }
            //** interrpt here
            retne();
            ```
            
        - Problem: ** in prologue and prolog decides epilog, relay relized the locker is still locked→enqueue(), so the retne() will be not excuted for a long time.
        - solution: run epilogue with intr enabled, when no element on queue, place ** still intr disabled.
        
        ```cpp
        While(1){
        	cli
        	e = q.dequeue();
        	if(!e) {// no epi on queue
        		break;
        	}
        	sti
        	e.epilogue();
        }
        //** interrpt here
        retne();
        sti
        ```
        
- Gate::queued()
    - agenda: enqueue object multiple times the next pointer will be overwritten by another next pointer.
- Interactions between prologue and epilogue
    - data structure shared in prologue and epilogue still need to synchronization
    - solution : non blocking or hard  synchron or use a simple global variable.

# document

## Descreption:

- Hard synchronisation→task 2
- Prologue/Epilogue model →task 3

## Paket

### Guard

- Descreption: The Guard class is used for synchronization between "normal" core activities (currently outputs, later system calls) and interrupt handling routines.
- ****public methods****
    - **void leave ()**
        - leaving the critical section and processing the accumulated epilogues.
    - **void relay (Gate* item)**
        - Prologue return ture → execute Epilogue
            - CS free →immediately execute
            - CS occupied →add in waiting list
- notice that epilogues can be interrupted by prologues,
    - interrupts should be allowed again before the epilog of an interrupt handler is executed.

### ****Secure****

- Descreption: using it to mark critical code areas
    - cuz the constructor and deconstructor is valid in the scope
- ****public methods****
    - **Secure ()**
        - enter the  by guard protected  CS .
    - **~Secure ()**
        - leave the CS again

### Gate

- Description: Abstrakt class for object, which entered into plugbox

### Guardian

- Description: The guardian function represents the central interruption handling. After an interruption occurs, the processor first jumps to the wrapper routine entered in the vector table. This then calls guardian, whereby the number of the corresponding interruption is passed on as a parameter. All interruptions therefore always lead to the activation of guardian.
- query the object which sent a interrupt request
- prologue insteads of trigger.

### Locker

- Description: protect CS.
- ****öffentliche Methoden****
    - **Locker ()**
        - lock variable
            - set to 1→CS belegt
            - set to 0→CS free
    - **void enter ()**
    - **void retne ()**
    - **bool avail ()**

## Device

### Keyborad

- Divide trigger() into two parts
    - prologue() :
        - short section, reacts to the interruptions caused by the keyboard
        - valid key_hit →return 1
        - ctrl + alt + del→reboot
    - epilogue()
        - actual work
        - put the character (in prologue() readed)on screen

### Questions

- Guard::relay
    - excute [epilog: enter()](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/shiyue-task3/guard/guard.cc#L42) should before cpu.enable_int(). the ctrl flow will not switch on diffrent level.
    
    - after leavng CS not need to [disable interrupt](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/shiyue-task3/guard/guard.cc#L46) again. cuz it direktly jump back to IH.
