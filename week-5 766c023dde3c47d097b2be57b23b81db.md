# **Lecture : Interrupts – Synchronization**

# some methods used to solve the synchrinization issue.

- One-sided synchronization → disable and enable interrupts, works with one-sided synchronization.
- only consume() can be interrupted.

- Conclusion : A→normal application ctrl flow, IH→interrupt handler
    - IH interrupt A
        - implicitly, at an arbitrary point
        - always higher priority, runs to completion
    - A disable IH(better: delay)
        - explicitly, with cli / sti
    - Synchronization / maintenance of consistency is one-sided

## Control-Flow Level Model

- Normal case
    - L0→A; L1→IH
    - Prio. L1 > L0

![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 162453.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_162453.png)

- Control flows of the same level are sequentialized
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 162919.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_162919.png)
    
    - multiple control flows on one level are ready,  they are
    executed sequentially
    - Arbitrary sequentialization strategy(FIFO; LIFO.....)
- Control flows can switch levels
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 164454.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_164454.png)
    
    - With cli an L0 control flow explicitly switches to L1
        - other ctrl flow on L1 in this case will be delayed
    - With sti an L1 control flow explicitly switches to L0
        - now the been delayed ctrl flow on L1 will finally get their trun to run
- Generalization to multiple interrupt levels:
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 165046.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_165046.png)
    
    - ctrl flows can be intertupted by ctrl flows on lower level(bigger Nr), never be interrupted by ctrl flows on higher level, and sequentialized by ctrl flows on the same level.
    - Control flows can switch levels by special operations (here: modifying the status register)
- how to maintain Consistency
    - Motivation : Each state variable is (logically) assigned
    to exactly one level Lf
        - for ctrl flows form the same level accesses →sequentialization
        - for ctrl flows form lower or higher level →maintain consistency
    - Measures for maintaining consistency?
        - for ctrl flows from above(lower prio) → hard synchronization
            - explicitly switch(e. g L0 switch to L1) : delay intr on L1
            - thereby, the access comes from the same level. →sequentialzation
        - for ctrl flows from below → nonblocking synchronization
            - later, not easy

## Hard Synchronization

- Bounded Buffer – Hard Synchronization
    - bounded buffer resides on L1

![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled.png)

- pro and cons
    - + Maintains consistency : for complex data structures and access patterns also wroks and independent for compiler.
    - + Simple to use (for the developer), always works
    - - Broadband effect : delay all ctrl flows with higher prio
    - - Priority violation : delay ctrl flows with high Prio.
    - - Pessimism .. 虽然中断概率很小，但是缺点太拉跨。
- Assessment
    - we should considerate the delay’s frequency, mean duration, maximum duration when it comes to significants of this mechanism. Maximum duration is the most critical thing cuz it directly influences the (to be expected) latency and Latency too high data can get lost which leads....
        - Interrupts aren’t noticed
        - Data is picked up too slowly from I/O devices
    - max delay is most important measure of disadvantages:
        - directly influences the (to be expected) latency
        - Latency too high data can get lost
            - interrupts aren’t noticed
            - Data is picked up too slowly from I/O devices
    - Conclusion:Hard synchronization is rather unsuitable
    for maintaining consistency of complex data structures(file system ect ).

## Nonblocking Synchronization

### for Consumer-Producer-Problem:

![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 180104.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_180104.png)

- consume() generates a correct result even if during its
execution produce() was executed.
- Consistency condition:
    - The result of interrupt exec. (figure above)must be equal to an arbitrary sequential exec.(e.g  C() after or before P() )
- older version
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 185237.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_185237.png)
    
    - occupied is write by both sides
- new version 1
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 185836.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_185836.png)
    
    - but still 2 states readed by one side and written by other
        - nextout is written by C() and readed by P()
        - nextin : same
    - so we must check if it holds consistency condition. Assuming the intr occurs
        - C() before reading nextin →P() before C()   ✅
            - P() runs to completion before C()
        - C() after reading nextin →C() before P()      ✅
            - didn’t modify nextin in C() after the 1 line in C(),  P() runs to completion and stays the data consistency.
        - P() before writting nextout→P() before C()  ✅
            - we may lose data in this case, p() would thought this buffer is still full but in fact it is not.
        - P() after writting nextout→C() before P()     ✅
            - C() runs to completion before() P() doing anything.

### for system time

![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 192548.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_192548.png)

- Consistency condition:
    - The result of interrupt exec. must be equal to an arbitrary sequential exec.(e.g  time() after or before timerHanler() )
- Approach:
    1. read data and pretend we are not interrupted.
    2. check were we interrupted?
    3. if interrupted→return 1.
- new version
    
    ![屏幕截图 2022-05-06 193033.png](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-06_193033.png)
    
    - pro and cons
        - + Maintains consistency :(by interrupt transparency)
        - + No priority violations (interrupts stay enabled!)
        - + No cost, or only in the (rare) conflict situation,
            - no cost →bounded-buffer example
            - in the conflict situation→optimistic approaches, system-time example (additional cost by restarting)
        - - Complexity
        - - Constraints
            - Tiny code changes can ruin the consistency guarantee
            - Compiler’s code generation must be taken into account
        - - Predictability
            - Costs for restart unpredictable for large amounts of data
    - Conclusion
        - the involved algorithm is a special solution for a special case. It is not suitable as a generally applicable measure.

## Prologue/Epilogue Model

- Motivation:
    - Hard synchronisation is simple and always works, but it has long delay when accessing state from the level with smaller Nr or modifying state in IH
    
    ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - caused by: the logical state stays in the HW interrupt level(figure above L1...LN)
- Solution
    
    ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - add another level named L½→ Epilogue Level
    - IH is divided into prologue and epilogue
        - Prologue runs on interrupt level L1...n
        - Epilogue runs on (software) level L½
            - State resides (as far as possible) on here
- Prologue
    - runs on hardware-interrupt level has the highest priority
    - touches little states or no state
    - short and modify few or no states
    - can request an epilogue on demand
- Epilogue
    - runs on additional control-flow level, being delay or not is depended on prologue
    - does the actual work
    - has access to most of the state.  State is synchronized on the epilogue level
- Implementation
    
    ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled%204.png)
    
    1. enter the epilogue level:  → corresponds to cli
    2. Interrupt is signaled on level L1, execute prologue.
    3. Prologue requests epilogue for delayed execution (relay).
    4. Prologue terminates, interrupted L½ control flow (application) continues.
    5. Application control flow leaves epilogue level L½ (leave), process meanwhile accumulated epilogues.
    6. Epilogue terminates, application control flow continues on L0
    - When do we have to process pending epilogues?
        - Just before the CPU returns to L0, While the application ctrl flow run on epilogue/processing epilogues/the CPU executed control flows on levels L1...n, epilogues may have accumulated.

### AST(asynchronous system trap)

- idea: when u r in intr level, u trigger AST explicitly form SW.and by that u signaled that i want a epilog to be run.and u say i am returnning form IHR, and going back up to appl level, the HW automatically excutes the AST intr handler, that’s actually the point you can excute epilogue. this can happen be simply by seting a bit in register.
- is an interrupt that can only be requested by software.
- set a bit in a specific register
- comparable to a HW interrupt
- main difference to traps / exceptions / software interrupts:
    - AST is executed asynchronously
    - to what is AST asychronusly
        - press a key → endup into IH → keyboard IH request an AST, sets a bit, when returning from intr level, the other IH is excuted → form the perspectiv of appl   :  intr level is excuted asychronously to the appl ctrl flow.
    - runs on L½ level(interrupt level), which is between L0 and  HW IH level.
- AST can simplifies ensuring epilogues are processed
    - Processing in AST (automatically, before returning to L0)
    - what we need to do is manage pending epilogues
- example : TriCore

```cpp
//L1 is now where AST been implemented
//L2 is where HW intr start
void enter() {
 CPU::setIRQL(1); // setting level to 1, delay AST
}
void leave() {
 CPU::setIRQL(0); // allow AST (pending
} // AST would now be processed)
void relay(<Epilogue>) {
 <enqueue epilogue in queue>
 CPU_SRC1::trigger(); // activate level-1 IRQ (AST)
}
void __attribute__((interrupt_handler)) irq1Handler() {
 while (<Epilogue in queue>) {  //process all pending epi
 <dequeue epilogue from queue>
 <process epilogue>
} }
```

- now we don’t need to disable hardware interrupts anymore, but we still need to considerate one issue about epilogue queue
    - when prologue runs and called relay(), we need to store the info in some sort of data structure(queue). when we excuted epilogue, we need to read and modify this queue(enqueue a epi), before we go back to L0, we need to process all pending epilogues and clear them again from queue, for accomplishing this we have 2 options here
        1. Hard synchronisation : put queue on L1, and do Hard synchronisation when access this queue.
            - prologue calls relay(), realy() can modify queue cuz they are on the same level.
            - if we are on L1/2, every time we do dequeue, we have to do a short intr to go to L1 and modify the queue.
                
                ![Untitled](week-5%20766c023dde3c47d097b2be57b23b81db/Untitled%205.png)
                
        2. put queue on L1/2 and do some sort of nonblocking synchronization
            - enqueue can interrupt dequeue

### Assessment

- PROs and CONs
    - + Maintains consistency (synchronization on epilogue level)
    - + Programming model corresponds to the (easily understandable)model behind hard synchronization
    - + Also complex state can be synchronized
        - without losing any IRQs
        - protect all kernel states
    - - Additional level———→ additional overhead
    - - Shared state between prologue and epilogue must still be synchronized hard or nonblockingly
- gerneral
    - good compromise for synchronizing accesses to kernel state.
    - suitable for maintaining consistency of complex data structures.
