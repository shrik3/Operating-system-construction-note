# Lecture

## Compilation/Linking

- Complication, Assembly and Linking: [https://www.cnblogs.com/glacierh/p/4678229.html](https://www.cnblogs.com/glacierh/p/4678229.html)
- why program can not run on bare metal?
    1. no dynamic linker avalibale
        
        →we donot have “loader” on bare machine, libs will be loaded at wrong time.
        
    2. no syscall → we cannot use regular std c++ lib
    3. Generated addresses refer to virtual memory, we donnot know if there’s memory mapped to this virtuell address.
    4. High-level language code excepts environment been setted in some way. (e.g direction Flag is cleared)
- Is OS development in a high-level programming language
possible at all?
    - yes but we can *not* use standard lib of c++

## Booting

### Process

1. system start
2. Jump (via RESET vector or directly) to fixed address
3. BIOS or firmware start/ROM OS start
4. Copy data segments, initialize BSS
5. Hardware init and test 
    - error →system stop
    - BIOS→Search for boot medium, load and start system
        - error →system stop
        - OS loaded → DONE
6. OS came from ROM→DONE

### Boot Sector

### Boot loader :used by ooStubs

- system-specific boot loaders
    - Define hardware/software state
    - opt. Load further blocks with boot-loader code
    - Pinpoint the actual system on the boot media
    - Load the system (via BIOS functions)
    - Jump into loaded system
- Boot loader on disks not flagged as “bootable”
    - Error message, halt / reboot
- Boot loader with boot menu (e.g., GRUB)
    - Display a menu
    - Emulate BIOS when booting the selected system
    (load boot block to 0x7c00, jump)

## Testing and Debugging

### “printf Debugging”

- you need to has your own printf and stuff
- printf() often changes the debuggee’s behavior
- similar behaviour: LED, Serial interface

### (Software) Emulators

- + Simplifies debugging
- + Shorter development cycles
- - Emulator and real hardware may differ in details!
- - Harder to find bugs in a complete system than during incremental development
- Emulation: a special case of virtualization
Provides a virtual resource Y (e.g., an Arm CPU)
based on a resource X (e.g., the systems x86-64 host CPU
