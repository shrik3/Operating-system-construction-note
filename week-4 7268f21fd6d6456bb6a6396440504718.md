# **Lecture : Interrupts – Software**

## TERMs we may used for next lectures

- **3 categories**
    - **Instruction cannot be executed**
        - e .g PF, Protection fault, /0 ....
        - Intel IA-32:(softwaregenerated) exceptions fault, trap, or abort
        - Motorola/Freescale CPU32 : internal exception
        - Infineon TC1: (synchronous) hardware trap
        - Literature (Stallings): TRAP : Handling of an error or an exception condition
        - Literature (Silberschatz): EXPECTION: Handling of an error or an exception condition
    - **Instruction triggers voluntary mode switch**
        - e.g syscall, breakpoint instructions
        - Intel IA-32:  software(-generated) interrupts
        - Motorola/Freescale CPU32 : instruction trap exception
        - Infineon TC1: (synchronous) software trap
        - Literature (Stallings): Supervisor Call, Call to an operating system function
        - Literature (Silberschatz): Software interrupt / trap
        Call to an operating system function
    - **Device requires attention**
        - Timer alarm, Key pressed, “NMI”
        - Intel IA-32: external (hardwaregenerated) interrupts
        - Motorola/Freescale CPU32 : external exception(= interrupt)
        - Infineon TC1: interrupt (asynchronous) hardwaare trap: “NMI”, “DMA” error
        - Literature (Stallings): Interrupt :  Reaction to an asynchronous external event
        - Literature (Silberschatz):Interrupt: Reaction to an asynchronous external event

## why we need interrupts in first place?

- It would be a lot of useless work to have the kernel periodically poll the device in order to process it, because peripherals are generally slower to process than the CPU, and the CPU cannot wait for external events all the time. So being able to have the device actively notify the kernel when it needs, it would be a smart way to go, and that is interrupts.
- another option is using busy-waitting:
    - + PROs
        - low latency
    - - CONs
        - by busy waitting the cpu can’t do anything else.
        - only make sence when cpu hat only 1 task....
        - waste energy..

## Distinguish Trap and Interrupt

![Untitled](week-4%207268f21fd6d6456bb6a6396440504718/Untitled.png)

- Trap : triggerd by an instruction
    - trap or int instruction for syscalls
    - Undefined result(/0)
    - Hardware problem(bus error)
    - PF(need OS do sth)
    - Invaild instruction(programming error)
    - Porperities
        - normally predictable, often reproducible
        - Restart or abort the triggering activity
- INTR : triggerd by hardware
    - Hardware requires attention by software
    (Timer, Keyboard controller, Hard-disk controller, …)
    - Porperities
        - not predictable, not reproducible
        - resume the interrupted activity

## Basic Assumptions

### Assumption: Handler Routine : The CPU automatically starts the handler routine.

- Necessitates dispatch to a handler : decide which handler is responsible for the intr request
- classic solution is : Vector tables

![Untitled](week-4%207268f21fd6d6456bb6a6396440504718/Untitled%201.png)

- Register contains vector-table start address: this table could start at the adress that defined in the cpu register
- Instead adress the table can directly contain code, which usually jumps to the handler routine, cuz the space for actual machine code is normally limited.
- In some architectures: programmable “event controller” handles interrupt in hardware
- Table contains descriptors
- Handler routine has own process context

### Assumption: Supervisor mode : Interrupt handling takes place in supervisor mode.

- Only the OS may access devices without restrictions.
    - Before interrupt handling, the CPU switches to the privileged supervisor mode.
- Interrupts are the only mechanism to preempt noncooperative applications.
- but for some CPUs, the subdivision ( user and supervisor ) is not exist.

### Assumption: State Save : The interrupted program can be resumed.

- OPTIONS
    - more information on cause/trigger on the stack
    - no priorities
    - special “interrupt stack”
    - State save in registers(make sence when nesting is not allowed)

### Assumption: Atomic Behavior : Machine instructions are atomic.

- Defined CPU state when handler routine starts
- State restorable
- Ideally, all stages are always in use, i.e. multiple instructions are
executed in parallel. When should we check whether an IRQ has
been issued?
    - All instructions preceding the instruction indicated by the saved program counter have been executed and have modified the process state correctly

### Assumption: Interrupt Suppression : Interrupt handling can be disabled/suppressed.

- WHY :Automatic suppression by the CPU before starting the handler routine?
    - 中断不能预测
    - a stack overflow would be possible
- Hardware disable all INTR or INTR with lower and same priority.
- option : Suppress interrupts that are currently being handled
    - cuz there will has low latency when without preference for indicidual devices.

## Saving State(implemented in oostubs startup.asm)

- Both the main program and the interrupt service subroutine use the CPU's internal registers and other resources. In order for the interrupt handler not to destroy the contents of the registers in the main program, the contents of each register at the breakpoint should first be pressed into the stack to protect it
- Any state the interrupted program does not expect to asynchronously change
    - must not be modified in an interrupt handler or
    - must be saved, and restored afterwards
- total save
    - Handler routine saves all registers that were not automatically saved
        - con : probably saves too much, overhead
        - pro : + saved state easily accessible (one coherent data structure)
- Partial save
    - Handler only saves registers that
        - 1) are modified in the interrupt handler
        - 2) are not saved/restored by other parts of the handler*
        - (*) or the functions it calls directly or indirectly
            - PROs:
                - overhead by determinating which regs will be changed(but we can do this offline or in compiler step)
            - Cons: - saved state is “scattered” (not in one place, hard to access)
        - Feasible if actual handler is implemented in a high-level language, e.g. C/C++
            - + only state that actually gets modified is saved/restored
            - + possibly less instructions for save/restore necessary
            - – saved state is “scattered” (not in one place, hard to access)
    - Transition to High-level language

    - what should partial save in wrapper routine :
        - instrction pointer and start register is automaticlly saved(basic by cpu saved)
        - all volatile register. because call funktion garantie will not modify non-volatile registers, volatile register are allowed to be modified arbitraryly by the compiler generated code. before we return the intr programm we need to make sure all states has the old state back.

![Untitled](week-4%207268f21fd6d6456bb6a6396440504718/Untitled%202.png)

- Volatile and Non-volatile Register
    - non-volatile Register: callee-saved register
        - Compiler guarantees that the stored value is conserved across function calls
        - callee is responsible for saving the register after using.
    - volatile Register: a caller-saved or scratch
        - caller must save/restore all by itself, if it still needs the value after function call.
        - usually used for intermediate result
    - usually defined in a standard all compilers adhere to
        - why is it make sense to follow a standard?
            - If you don't, you can link to an objekt file compiled by another compiler or to a lib compiled by another compiler, because each function you call in the lib interprets the registers that need to be saved or restored differently than you do.
        - e.g. x86-64 (“System V AMD64 ABI”):
            - non-volatile: rbx, rbp, r12-r15
            - all others are volatile: rax, rcx, rdx, rdi, rsi, r8-r11, eflags, FPU/SSE registers, …
- Restoring State
    - As its last duty, wrapper must restore saved register contents, and must not again modify them afterwards!
    - A special instruction (e.g. rte or iret) completes the restore procedure:
        - Reads automatically saved state from supervisor stack
        - Sets the saved CPU mode (user/supervisor), jumps to saved address

## Modifying State : main purpose of interrupt handling

- the problem should be noticed by modifying state:
    - not all simple instructions are atomic, it depends on CPU type, compiler, code optimizations.
    - critical : data structure shares between regular control flow and interrupt handling.

### Example 1 : system time

- timerHandler(): timer intr once per second
- system call time():  make global_time availble to the uer mode application.

![Untitled](week-4%207268f21fd6d6456bb6a6396440504718/Untitled%203.png)

![屏幕截图 2022-05-05 162435.png](week-4%207268f21fd6d6456bb6a6396440504718/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_2022-05-05_162435.png)

- Problem here : the lower 16 bit should be incremented first and then overflow leads to increment higher 16 bit by 1, but there was intr right after mov instruction of lower 16 bits, so only higher 16 bit was incremented.
- Every 18.2 hours, the system time can appear to be 18.2 hours ahead (for a short moment). Unfortunately, this is not reliably reproducible.

### Example 2: Ring Buffer

- Senario: ring buffer used by keyboard intr handler. while appl is doing meaningful work, the user press a key, the keyboard IH interrupt appl, the IH reads charackter form Keyboard buffer and IH store input in buffer and intr is done.
    
    ![Untitled](week-4%207268f21fd6d6456bb6a6396440504718/Untitled%204.png)
    
- Problem
    - **The memory of buffer is limited**, if input is not handled/consumed fast enough, the buffer can fill up. The interrupt handler routine cannot store further input there. This input is lost.

    ![Untitled](week-4%207268f21fd6d6456bb6a6396440504718/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - **Buffer data structure can “break”**
        - inconsistent intermediate states during modifications by regular control flow
        - write while reading
        - write on copy
    - regular control flow do not interrupt the INTR handler

## Synchronization Techniques

- “Hard” Synchronization
    - disable interrupt →avoid race condition

    - problem
        - Hazard of losing interrupt requests
        - High and difficult to predict “interrupt latency”
