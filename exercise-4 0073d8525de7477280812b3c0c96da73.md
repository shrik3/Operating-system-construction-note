    1. appl want to do some modification with the buf[…] so it enter the epilogue level :  → enter() corresponds to cli
    2. Interrupt is signaled on level L1, execute prologue.
    3. Prologue requests epilogue for delayed execution (relay).
    4. Prologue terminates, interrupted L½ control flow (application) continues.
    5. Application control flow leaves epilogue level L½ (leave), process meanwhile accumulated epilogues.
    6. Epilogue terminates, application control flow continues on L0.
    

# tip &tricks

- Queue Class : manage epilogue
    - ‘tail’ is a pointer to the ‘next’ pointer in the last element
- Epilogue queue
    - why access the queue need to be sychronized?
        - when is Access happend.
            - L1/2 call leave() : dequeue
            - prolog call relay() : enqueue
        - these 2 part may leads to race condition
    - How to synchronize accesses?
        - easier: hard synchronization: we need to located queue on L1, when we want to access queue we need to switch to L1
        - non block synchronization: queue doesn’t break when dequeue is interrupt by enqueue, even more: when we in multilevel intr sys  we may have the situation enqueue is interrupted by enqueue.
            - Tthe queue is located in L1/2
- Guard::leave()
    - Which condition must hold when leaving this function?
        - there are no epilogs in queue→all epilogue was processed
            
            ```cpp
            While(1){
            	cli
            	e = q.dequeue();
            	sti
            	if(!e) {// valid pointer
            		break;
            	}
            	e.epilogue();// no problem cuz on L1/2
            }
            //** interrpt here
            retne();
            ```
            
        - Problem: ** in prolog and prolog decides epilog, relay realized the locker is still locked→enqueue(), so the retne() will be not excuted for a long time.
        - solution: run epilogue with intr enabled, when no element on queue, place ** still intr disabled.
        
        ```cpp
        While(1){
        	cli
        	e = q.dequeue();
        	if(!e) {// no epi on queue
        		break;
        	}
        	sti
        	e.epilogue();
        }
        //** interrpt here
        retne();
        sti
        ```
        
- Gate::queued()
    - agenda: enqueue object multiple times the next pointer will be overwritten by another next pointer.
- Interactions between prologue and epilogue
    - data structure shared in prologue and epilogue still need to synchronization
    - solution : non blocking or hard  synchron or use a simple global variable.

# document

## Descreption:

- Hard synchronisation→task 2
- Prologue/Epilogue model →task 3

## Paket

### Guard

- Descreption: The Guard class is used for synchronization between "normal" core activities (currently outputs, later system calls) and interrupt handling routines.
- ****public methods****
    - **void leave ()**
        - leaving the critical section and processing the accumulated epilogues.
    - **void relay (Gate* item)**
        - Prologue return ture → execute Epilogue
            - CS free →immediately execute
            - CS occupied →add in waiting list
- notice that epilogues can be interrupted by prologues,
    - interrupts should be allowed again before the epilog of an interrupt handler is executed.

### ****Secure****

- Descreption: using it to mark critical code areas
    - cuz the constructor and deconstructor is valid in the scope
- ****public methods****
    - **Secure ()**
        - enter the  by guard protected  CS .
    - **~Secure ()**
        - leave the CS again

### Gate

- Description: Abstrakt class for object, which entered into plugbox

### Guardian

- Description: The guardian function represents the central interruption handling. After an interruption occurs, the processor first jumps to the wrapper routine entered in the vector table. This then calls guardian, whereby the number of the corresponding interruption is passed on as a parameter. All interruptions therefore always lead to the activation of guardian.
- query the object which sent a interrupt request
- prologue insteads of trigger.

### Locker

- Description: protect CS.
- ****öffentliche Methoden****
    - **Locker ()**
        - lock variable
            - set to 1→CS belegt
            - set to 0→CS free
    - **void enter ()**
    - **void retne ()**
    - **bool avail ()**

## Device

### Keyborad

- Divide trigger() into two parts
    - prologue() :
        - short section, reacts to the interruptions caused by the keyboard
        - valid key_hit →return 1
        - ctrl + alt + del→reboot
    - epilogue()
        - actual work
        - put the character (in prologue() readed)on screen

### Questions

- Guard::relay
    - excute [epilog: enter()](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/shiyue-task3/guard/guard.cc#L42) should before cpu.enable_int(). the ctrl flow will not switch on diffrent level.
    
    - after leavng CS not need to [disable interrupt](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/shiyue-task3/guard/guard.cc#L46) again. cuz it direktly jump back to IH.
    

# Task 4

## Overview

- Coroutine : involve context switching
    - asm code : save the context of a coroutine and restoring context into another coroutine
    - each coroutine must know which coroutine is next one and which is running now
- Dispatcher : remembers which coroutine is current activ one
- Scheduler : has ready list contains all ready-to-run coroutines and pick the first one from the queue and dispatch it.
- toc : holding the context for the coroutine.

## x86-64 Assembler Programming

- What is an Assembler?
    - Component between compiler and linker, compiler to transform code of an assembler program to machine code
    
    ![Untitled](exercise-4%200073d8525de7477280812b3c0c96da73/Untitled%201.png)
    
- What is an assembler capable of?
    - Understands only a few complex expressions
        - input language corresponds to CPU instruction set!
        - simple calculations and preprocessing at assenbly time
    - Higher programming languages are translated to simpler instructions by the compiler:

### Example

- C statement:          sum = a + b + c + d;
    - Too complex for the assembler, must be broken down to multiple steps!
- x86-64 assembler can only add two numbers and store the result in one of the two used “variables” (accumulator register)
- This C program is structurally closer to an assembler program:
    - sum = a;
    sum = sum + b;
    sum = sum + c;
    sum = sum + d;
    - would look e.g. like this in x86-64 assembler:
    
    ```nasm
    mov rax, [a]
    add rax, [b]
    add rax, [c]
    add rax, [d]
    ```
    
- An assembler …
    - supports only primitive operations
    - works in a line-oriented fashion (line = machine instruction)
- Control structures: “if”
    - Simple if-then-else constructs are already too complex for an assembler:
        
        ```cpp
        if ( a == 4711 ) {
        ...
        } else {
        ...
        }
        ```
        
        ```nasm
        					cmp rax, 4711 ; compare rax to 4711
        					jne unequal   ; unequal -> jump
        equal: ...              ; else continue here
        					jmp cont      ; skip over else branch
        unequal: ...            ; else branch
        cont: ...               ; continue with other stuff
        ```
        
- Loops: Simple “for” Loop
    - A simple counting loop is actually better supported:
    
    ```nasm
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
     sum = sum + a;
    }
    ```
    
    ```nasm
    				mov rcx, 100
    repeat: add rax, [a]
    			  loop repeat
    ```
    
- loop instruction:
    - Implicitly decrements RCX register
    - Jumps only if RCX ≠ 0

### What is a Register?

- Extremely fast, very small storage within the CPU that can (in x86-64 CPUs) store 64 bits
- Compiler: Mapping of high-level language variables to
storage locations in the data/BSS segment of an object file
- Calculations with variables: Usually beforehand loading memory → register necessary

### Memory

- In most of the cases, registers do not suffice to implement an
algorithm
    - Memory access is necessary
- Main memory: Functionally like a gigantic array of registers, selectively 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits “wide”
    - smallest addressable unit: Byte
    - memory cells numbered consecutively index
    - accesses are several 100x slower than to registers
- Access via addresses
- Example:
- 

![Untitled](exercise-4%200073d8525de7477280812b3c0c96da73/Untitled%202.png)

```nasm
[SECTION .data]
greeting: db 'hello, world'
answer: dw 42
million: dd 1000000
[SECTION .text]
mov ax, [million]
```

![Untitled](exercise-4%200073d8525de7477280812b3c0c96da73/Untitled%203.png)

- ax is only 16 bit

### The Stack

- Variables stored at fixed memory addresses are accessible from all parts of the assembler program
    - via address or symbolic names (“labels”) → global variables
- However, for particular purposes we need non-global variables
    - Isolation between functions / objects
    - Recursively callable functions
- Stack: Temporary LIFO storage for values “as long as they are needed”
    - allows dynamic allocation of variables
    - addressed with relative addresses
- Push operation: Store values “on top” of the stack (inverse: Pop)
    - memory address at which push/pop operate: special register, the socalled stack pointer (x86-64: rsp)
    - No need to care about concrete value of stack pointer; only remember order in which we pushed values!

### Addressing Modes

- Most instructions can use registers, memory, or constants as operands
- The mov instruction allows the following modes (among others)
(1st operand: target, 2nd operand: source):

### Functions

- … known from higher-level programming languages …
    - Advantage compared to goto: Call from arbitrary location in your program, return/continue the calling program part
    - The function itself doesn’t need to know where it was called from, and
    where to return afterwards (this happens automatically – how?)
- Not only data but also your program lies in main memory
    - each machine-code instruction has its own address
- Special Instruction Pointer register (rip) points to the next
instruction to be executed
- Processor executes instruction, then usually increases rip by
the length of the instruction
    - → rip points to the next instruction
- **Jump instruction**: Changes **rip** to target address (absolute, or
rip-relative)
- **Function call**: like a jump, plus saves the **return address**
    - old rip value (plus instruction length) = next instruction addr is saved on the stack
- **Function return**: ret pops address from stack, jumps there

![Untitled](exercise-4%200073d8525de7477280812b3c0c96da73/Untitled%208.png)

![Untitled](exercise-4%200073d8525de7477280812b3c0c96da73/Untitled%209.png)

- Parameters: the first 6 in registers, further ones on the stack
- Parameters on the stack must be removed again afterwards
(with pop, or by directly modifying rsp)

```nasm
mov rdi,rax ; first parameter for f1 in rdi
mov rsi,rbx ; second parameter in rsi
mov rdx,r13 ; third parameter in rdx
; … …
push r15 ; seventh parameter on the stack
call f1
add rsp, 8 ; remove seventh param. from stack
```

- Access to parameters within the function:
    - Simplified by using the base pointer **rbp**
    - Convention: Save **rbp** at the beginning of a function, set to **rsp**
        - access the 7th parameter via [rbp+16]
        - access the 8th parameter via [rbp+24] …
    - … independently from whether **rsp** was changed in the meantime
    (e.g. using push or pop)

```nasm
f2: push rbp
		mov rbp,rsp
		 ...
		 mov rbx,[rbp+16] ; load 7th parameter to rbx
		 mov rax,[rbp+24] ; load 8th parameter to rax
		 ...
		 pop rbp
		 ret
```

### Calling Assembler Functions

- An assembler-code label can be exported to the linker – also a function address:

![Untitled](exercise-4%200073d8525de7477280812b3c0c96da73/Untitled%2012.png)

- Now a C++ program can call the function
    - However, the compiler needs a (matching) declaration:
        - extern "C" void toc_go(struct toc* regs);
    - The assembler code can expect the parameter in **rdi**.
    - Non-volatile registers may need to be saved/restored!
