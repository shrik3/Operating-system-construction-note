# C++ (2), Keyboard, Interrupts

# C++ Crash Course (Part 2)

## Compiling and Linking

### C/C++ Build Process

- Preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linkage in one step: **gcc hello1.c**
    - Generates binary file a.out
    
    ![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled.png)
    
    - hello1.i : output of the preprocessor

### Source Code – Preprocessor

- ● Two file extensions:
    - .cc — C++ source code
    - .h — „Header Files“ with definitions of data types, constants, preprocessor macros etc.
- File extensions are only convention, variants:
    - .C, .cpp, .cxx, .hpp, .hh
- The preprocessor textually “integrates” header files in .cc files
    - #include directive:
        - #include <iostream> for system headers
        - #include "device.h" for own header files
- More preprocessor functionality:
    - Macros, e.g. for constants (without semicolon!)
    
    ```cpp
    #define pi 3.1415926
    #define VGA_BASE 0xb8000
    ```
    
    - Conditional compilation:
    
    ```cpp
    #ifdef DEBUG
    …
    #endif
    
    #ifndef VGA_BASE
    #define VGA_BASE 0xb8000
    #endif
    ```
    
- The preprocessor expands macros, integrates header-file contents, and generates a new text file (.i) as compiler input.
- Important use-case for #define and #ifndef:
    - Header files may include other header files infinite recursion →
    possible!
    - Preventing repeated inclusion of header files:
    
    ```cpp
    #ifndef __cgastr_include__
    #define __cgastr_include__
    #include "object/o_stream.h"
    #include "machine/cgascr.h"
    class CGA_Stream
    /* Add your code here */
    {
    /* Add your code here */
    };
    #endif
    ```
    
- [#pragma](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Pragmas.html)

### Source Code – Compiler

- Generates an object file (.o) from preprocessed source code
    - gets preprossor srouce code and compiles it to assembly, assembler make the code to mashine code
    - Generally **not directly executable**: unresolved references to functions or variables from other object files
    - Checks code for **syntactic and semantic** correctness, may
        - … abort compilation and print an error message (errors)
        - … emit warnings that could be a sign of a problem
        - Warnings do not abort compilation, but do not ignore them!

### Source Code – Linker

- Links a set of object files (.o) and possibly libraries (.a, .so) to an executable binary:
    - Resolve references
        - if one translation unit has a function call that’s defines in another translation unit, in compilation step cannot be resolved cuz the compiler handles 1 translation unit at one time. the linkers job is to resolve all these references to other translation units
    - Sort/group object-file parts/sections in memory map of executable
- Two linking modes:
    - **dynamic**: Libraries are loaded when starting the program, reference resolution at start- or even at runtime (“lazy linkage”)
        - + security benifit:  if u have a security bug in a lib, u can simply update this one lib, if the lib is static linked, then all lib need to be recompiled
        - - efficency problem: dynamic linking starting when u start the programm and takes time
    - **static**: Libraries are linked at link/build time, yielding a completely linked “static” binary containing all external dependencies.
        - + donot have to separatly install additional libraries in ur target system u want to run ur code on, because u r shipping it in one statically linked lib
        - - binary will be really big(in hard disk also in mem),
            - if u have 2 program that u want to link, the standard c++ lib will be load into mem twice.

### Virtual Functions

- Specially “marked” function of a base class (keyword: virtual)
- Derived class may **override** it, thereby providing a **specialized implementation** for its instances (however, this also works with non-virtual functions)
- For classes with ≥1 virtual functions, each object “knows” from which class in the hierarchy it was instantiated →correct function gets called in polymorphic scenarios
- **Not every function is virtual** by default (unlike in Java)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class base {
public:
	 virtual void display() {
	 cout << "Base";
 }
};
class derived : public base {
public:
	 void display() {
	 cout << "Derived";
 }
};
void main() {
	 base *ptr = new derived;
	 ptr->display();
}
```

- Output:      ”Derived”
- without virtual in front of     void base::display():
    - Output:      ”Base”
- **Rule of thumb**: A class with a **virtual function** should also have a **virtual destructor**
    - A non-virtual destructor does not guarantee correct destruction of derived classes.
        - If one exists anyways, this can even be interpreted such that its author didn’t intend (and doesn’t recommend) deriving from this class.

# Lab Task #1: Keyboard

## PC Keyboard

![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled%201.png)

## Key Encoding

- Each key has unique code (“Scan code”)
    - 7-bit number (max. 128 keys

![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled%202.png)

- Keyboard sends additional information
    - Make Code when pressing / while holding a key
    - Break Code when releasing a key

## Make and Break Codes

- General system:
    - Make code (key pressed) = Scan code
    - Break code (key released) = Scan code + 128 (Bit 7)
- Some keys send more than one code
    - e.g. function keys (F1-F12)
    - … for historic reasons (XT keyboard)
    - up to 3 make/break codes per key
- Built-in repeat functionality
    - Hardware sends additional make codes while holding a key
- Decoding is cumbersome
    - already implemented in OOStuBS template: bool key_decoded()

## Communication with Keyboard

- Keyboard controller: two I/O ports
    - Input/output register (data_port)               **0x60**
    - Control register (ctrl_port)                          **0x64**

![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled%203.png)

## Keyboard-Controller Status – Usage

- status register
    - 0: set, if there is a byte in the outputbuffer of the keyctrl that u can fetch. the keyboard send u something and this bit indicates u can take from the buffer
    - 1 : if u want to send commands to u keyboard, u have to wait until a byte u puted in to buffer was transferred. So u have to repeatly check whether this bit is cleared

![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled%204.png)

- Active keyboard polling (without interrupts):
    - Wait until outb in ctrl_port is set (1)
    - Read Make/Break code from data_port (clears ctrl_port.outb)
- Program keyboard (set_led, set_speed)
    - Write **command byte** to **data_port**
    - Keyboard replies with **ACK** (0xfa), need to wait for this reply (see above)
    - Write **data byte** to data_port (LED codes, repeat rate)
    - Keyboard replies with **ACK**, need to wait for this reply

## Keyboard Programming

- set_led 0xed, <led_mask> in data_port
- set_speed 0xf3, <config_byte> in data_port

# Interrupts on x86: PIC

## Hardware IRQs on x86 CPUs

- x86 CPUs up to and including i486: only one interrupt line (INT) + one NMI line
    - INT can be masked with IE bit in EFLAGS register
        - cli instruction (clear interrupt enable flag) – disable interrupt handling
        - sti instruction (set interrupt enable flag) – enable interrupt handling
    - NMI cannot be masked in the CPU (**“non-maskable interrupt”**)
        - … PC still allows this via CPU-external hardware …
- External controller puts IRQ number on memory bus
    - PC: Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) 8259A
    - Communication protocol between CPU and PIC 8259A

## Hardware IRQ Sequence (with PIC)

![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled%206.png)

1. pic knows some devices trigger intr, PIC pulls up the intr pin of cpu
2. whaterver the cpu currently running cpu is halted,
3. CPU sends PIC the ack
4. the number that pic puts on the data bus
5. ack from cpu
6. cpu starts intr handling by running code that defines in the intr descriptor table, number n in 4 is the intr handler
7. ack from the end of intr to the PIC
8. IRET: return from IH 
9. CPU continue run the appl

![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled%209.png)

## State Saving

- When an interrupt occurs, the CPU automatically saves a part of its state on the stack
    - Active stack segment (ss)
    - Stack pointer (rsp)
    - Condition codes (rflags)
        - easily destory by IH
    - Active code segment (cs)
        - easily destory by IH
    - Return address (rip)
        - if we donot save, wdk where to continue excutions when we done intr
    - For some exceptions (=“traps”): additionally an error code (8 bytes)

![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled%2010.png)

- Automatically saved state is restored by iretq instruction
    - If handler uses other registers, it must save/restore them by itself!

![Untitled](exercise-2%20776ad02350184edd84b2c68d0093f634/Untitled%2011.png)

## Accessing PICs via I/O Ports

- Each PIC has 2 ports that can be read/written
- Data that can be written: ICW1-4, OCW1-3
    - ICW = **Initialization Control Word** – PIC initialization
    - OCW = **Operation Control Word** – Commands during operation
- Read data depends on command

# Lab Task #2: Interrupt Handling

- Interrupt handling starts in guardian() function
    - Parameter slot: IRQ number
    
    ```cpp
    void guardian( unsigned int slot ) {
     ... // call IRQ handler (Gate object)
    }
    ```
    
    - During interrupt handling, interrupts are disabled
        - Can be manually re-enabled via sti (wrapped in CPU::enable_int())
        - Automatically re-enabled when guardian() returns
- Actual (IRQ-specific) IRQ handlers
    - are instances of class Gate
    - are registered/deregistered in class Plugbox
